<H1>High-frequency interconnect analysis</h1>
</center>

<h2>
Description:
</h2>
<p>
The interconnect of integrated circuits has traditionally been modelled 
as a distributed RC network (most recently with explicit consideration of 
coupling capacitance to other signal lines).  As technology continues to 
scale and on-chip frequency content increases, the inductance of
the interconnect becomes more and more import.  Effects such as overshoot
and ringing can occur as interconnect response becomes dependent of 
the frequency-dependent current returns in the chip.
</p>
<p>
In our research, we are investigating and driving to commercial implementation
techniques for extracting inductance on-chip, which are capable of full-chip
extraction, combined with existing resistance and capacitance extraction
capability.  
We are also validating these inductance extraction techniques with unique
test structures and measurement circuitry that characterize high-frequency
interconnect response.
