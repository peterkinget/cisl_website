SWITCAP2 is a general simulation program for analyzing linear
switched-capacitor networks (SCN's) and mixed switched-capacitor/digital
(SC/D) networks.  The major features of the program are as follows:
<OL><LI> SWITCHING INTERVALS
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> An arbitrary number of switching intervals per switching period
is allowed.  The durations of the switching intervals may be unequal and
arbitrary.
<P>
 </DL><LI> NETWORK ELEMENTS
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> The program can simulate linear SCN's containing the following
types of ideal analog components: <font size=-1><small>ON</small></font>-<font size=-1><small>OFF</small></font> switches, linear
capacitors, linear voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS's), and
independent voltage sources.  The waveforms of the independent sources
may be continuous or piecewise-constant.  The switches in linear SCN's
are controlled by periodic clock waveforms only.
<P>
In addition to the above elements mentioned, a mixed SC/D
network may contain comparators and logic gates such as <font size=-1><small>AND</small></font>, <font size=-1><small>OR</small></font>, <font size=-1><small>NOT</small></font>, <font size=-1><small>NAND</small></font>, <font size=-1><small>NOR</small></font>, <font size=-1><small>XOR</small></font>, and <font size=-1><small>XNOR</small></font>.  The <font size=-1><small>ON</small></font>-<font size=-1><small>OFF</small></font> switches in a mixed SC/D
network may be controlled not only by periodic waveforms but also by
nonperiodic waveforms from the output of comparators and logic gates.
<P>
 </DL><LI> TIME-DOMAIN ANALYSES OF LINEAR SCN'S AND MIXED SC/D NETWORKS 
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> The program provides two kinds of time-domain analyses.  One is
only applicable for linear SCN's and it computes the transient response
of linear SCN's to any prescribed input waveform for  after
computing the steady-state values for a set of dc inputs for <I>t</I> ;<I>SPMlt</I>; 0.
<P>
The other time-domain analysis applies to mixed SC/D
networks as well as linear SCN's.  It computes the transient response of
networks <EM>without</EM> computing the steady-state values as initial
conditions.  A set of the initial condition of analog and digital nodes at
 may be specified by user.
<P>
 </DL><LI> VARIOUS WAVEFORMS FOR TIME DOMAIN ANALYSES
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> Various time-domain waveforms such as pulse, pulse train, cosine,
exponential, exponential cosine, piecewise linear, and dc sources are
available as the input for transient analysis.
<P>
 </DL><LI> FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSES OF LINEAR SCN'S
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> Since SCN's are time-varying networks, a single-frequency
sinusoidal input can produce a steady-state output containing many
frequency components.  The program can determine all of these output
frequency components for both continuous and piecewise-constant input
waveforms.  Z-domain quantities can also be computed.
<P>
Frequency-domain group delay and sensitivity analyses are
also provided.
<P>
 </DL><LI> BUILT-IN SAMPLING FUNCTIONS
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> Both the input and output waveforms may be sampled and held at
arbitrary instants to produce the desired waveforms for time- and
frequency-domain analyses of linear SCN's except for sensitivity
analysis.  The output waveforms may also be sampled with a train of
impulse functions for z-domain analyses.
<P>
 </DL><LI> SUBCIRCUIT FACILITY
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD>
Subcircuits, including analog and/or digital elements, may be defined with
symbolic values for capacitances, VCVS gains, clocks, and other
parameters.  The symbolic values may then be replaced with actual values
during each reference to a subcircuit.  This facility provides a
convenient means for building a library of often-used building-block
circuits from which more complicated circuits may be pieced together.  It
also facilitates a hierarchical design approach.
<P>
 </DL><LI> FINITE RESISTANCES, OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER POLES, AND SWITCH
PARASITICS
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD>
Finite resistances (say associated with nonideal switches or anti-aliasing
filters) may be simulated by equivalent SC networks.  To obtain good
accuracy, the switches associated with the finite-resistor equivalent SC
networks may be switched at a frequency much higher than both the input
signal frequency and the switching frequency of the actual switches of the
circuit.  The time-constants introduced by the resistors may be longer
than the length of an actual switching interval (i.e., the network need
not be equilibrated).
<P>
Operational amplifiers with limited frequency response
may also be simulated.  The frequency response may be modeled with an RC
network and then simulated with the R's replaced by equivalent SC networks.
<P>
Clock feedthrough from switch parasitics may be simulated
in both the time and the frequency domains.  The frequency-domain
simulation of this effect is particularly efficient using the dc
steady-state analysis capability of the program which does not require the
direct computation of the Fourier components of any clock waveform.
<P>
To incorporate these higher order effects in a
simulation, the subcircuit facility of the program may be used to
advantage.  A circuit can be simulated with, say, ideal elements at a high
level of abstraction, or complex subcircuits including parasitics and
nonidealities can be substituted for ideal elements to carry the simulation
to a lower level.  However, it must be warned that the simulation of these
nonideal effects is computationally time consuming due to the need for
higher switching rate to model the nonideal effects.
<P>
 </DL><LI> INPUT FILE COMPATIBILITY WITH SWITCAP
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD> The input parser in SWITCAP is completely rewritten to allow the
flexibility necessary to add new features.  However, the new parser in
SWITCAP2 is designed such that any old SWITCAP input files can be used in
SWITCAP2 without any modifications.  Should any incompatibilities come up,
please contact SWITCAP Distribution Center immediately.
<P>

<P>
Internally, SWITCAP2 consists of several different algorithms depending
on the type of desired analysis.  For time- and frequency-domain analyses
(excluding group delay and sensitivity analyses) of linear SCN's,
SWITCAP2 uses an algorithm based on the formulation published in
[<A HREF="ref.html#yt1">1</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf1">2</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf2">3</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf3">4</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf4">5</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf5">6</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf6">7</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf7">8</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf8">9</A>].  This formulation,
which was incorporated in the original SWITCAP [<A HREF="ref.html#scf5">6</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#scf6">7</A>], uses a
set of charge variables as the network variables for computation.  The
number of charge variables is typically very small.  For example, an <I>nth</I>
order filter implemented in a leap-frog configuration wherein the number
of integrators is the same as the order would have <I>n</I> charge variables per
switching interval.  As a result of the small number of network
variables, the iterative steps in the computation are very efficient.
The most memory-intensive portion of the computation is in the
preprocessing stage during which the network matrices to be used in the
subsequent iterations are computed and stored.  Because of this memory
requirement, a dynamic memory allocation scheme has been implemented.
With this allocation scheme, the maximum complexity (number of elements
times the number of unique switching intervals) of an SCN that can be
simulated is limited solely by the user's computer memory size.
<P>
The analytical expressions that allow exact analyses of group delay and
sensitivity for many-phase linear SCN's are derived from the above
mentioned state charge variable formulation [<A HREF="ref.html#ks1">10</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#ks2">11</A>].  The
analytical expressions not only lead to efficient algorithms for computing
the group delay and sensitivity but also retain efficiencies similar to
those that were realized for simple time- and frequency-domain analyses
using the state charge formulation.
<P>
The transient analysis of mixed SC/D networks is formulated in such a way
that separate algorithms are used for analog, digital, and interface
subgroups to take full advantage of their own properties.  Detailed
technical discussions of the algorithms and their applications can be
found in [<A HREF="ref.html#ks2">11</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#ks3">12</A>, <A HREF="ref.html#ks4">13</A>].
