<H1>High-frequency interconnect analysis</h1>
</center>

<h2>
Description:
</h2>
<p>
The interconnect of integrated circuits has traditionally been modelled 
as a distributed RC network (most recently with explicit consideration of 
coupling capacitance to other signal lines).  As technology continues to 
scale and on-chip frequency content increases, the inductance of
the interconnect becomes more and more import for both high-speed digital and RF 
design.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In our research, we are investigating and driving to commercial implementation
techniques for extracting inductance on-chip, which are capable of full-chip
extraction, combined with existing resistance and capacitance extraction
capability.  
</p>
<p>
Our work is being commercialized in Assura RCLX from <a href="http://www.cadence.com">Cadence Design Systems</a>
and this have been discussed in recent articles in <a href = "http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20010928S0146">EE Times</a>.

<p>
In this paper, we report the development of the first commercial full-chip,
three-dimensional, shapes-based RLCK extraction tool, developed as part of a 
university-industry collaboration.
This technique of return-limited inductances is used to provide a spart,
frequency-independent inductance and resistance network with self-inductances
that represent sensible "nominal" vlaues in the absence of mutual coupling.
Mutual inductanes are extracted for accurate noise analysis.
The tool, Assura RLCX, exploits high-capacity, scan-band techniques and disk
caching for inductance extraction as an extension to Cadence's existing Assura RCX
extractor.

<p>
Decreasing slew rates and efforts to reduce the RC delays of on-chip interconnect
through design and technology have resulted in the growing importance of inductance in 
analyzing inteconnect response for timing and noise analysis.
In this paper, we consider a practical approach for extracting approximate
inductances of on-chip interconnect.
This approach, which we call the method of return-limited inductances,
is based on performing the inductance modelling of signal lines and power-group lines
independently and on taking advantage of the power and groudn distribution of the chip to localize
inductive coupling.
A set of simple geometry-based matrix decomposition rules guide sparsificaiton in 
these extractions.
