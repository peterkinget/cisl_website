<font color=#ff0000>Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design With Floating-Gate MOS 
                Transistors

</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
We design in the era of the ever shinking power supply.  Many of the basic 
tried-and-true cells that are in our textbooks are or will soon be rendered 
unuseable due to this unrelenting downward march of Vdd.  In the face of 
such challenges, some have suggested that floating-gate MOS (FGMOS) 
transistors are useful devices for designing low-voltage circuits, mainly 
because they offer us the possibility of lowering their threshold voltages 
by programming their floating-gate charges appropriately.  However, since 
Shibata's introduction of the neuron MOS concept, we have realized that 
FGMOS transistors have more to offer than programmable threshold voltages.  
We can capacitively couple as many control gates as we would like into the 
floating gate of a FGMOS transistor, which opens up to us many new circuit 
topologies, many of which are very quite attractive for operation on a low 
power supply voltage.  In this talk, I will discuss some of our recent 
efforts in charting this new design space.

<font color=#ff0000>Internally Varying Analog Circuits:
                A Means for Minimizing Power Dissipation

</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
This talk examines the fundamental reasons for the large power
dissipation of dynamical analog circuits with large dynamic range. It is
shown that by allowing the internal attributes of circuits to vary in an
appropriate manner, such fundamental limitations can be bypassed in certain
cases. The talk reviews several techniques, developed by the analog group of
CISL in
the past several years, which make possible internally
varying analog circuits with invariant external behavior. These techniques
include
companding, dynamic biasing, and dynamic impedance scaling. Experimental
results from recently developed chips, which demonstrate over an order of
magnitude improvement compared to the state of the art,  are
described.

</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
Advanced silicon technologies have opened the doors to implement very
high-speed links for electrical, optical and wireless connections.
In parallel to higher bandwidth requirements, there is also a pressing need
for higher levels of integration in the wired and wireless communication
fields to bring the cost and power dissipation down while still complying
with stringent link requirements such as sensitivity, jitter and
bit-error-rate.
<p>
In this talk, we will review the research activities undertaken by the
Communication Circuits and Systems
department at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY in the
area of multi-Gb/s and microwave links using CMOS and SiGe technologies.

<font color=#ff0000>Power-Performance Efficiency Studies
</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
Power has emerged recently as a primary design variable in high-end
microprocessors. Naive focus on performance leads the system design into
inefficient power-performance operation. In order to design more
effectively it is important to have power-performance measures to guide the
design from technology through circuit design to micrarchitecture. The
first part of the presentation highlights hardware intensity, a measure of
the power-performance efficiency of a circuit design. Relations are derived
using this measure which have practical consequences for power budgeting
and for joint circuit-microarchitecture tradeoffs. The second part of the
presentation focusses on adding power to the analysis of microarchitectural
pipelining. The results illustrate the hazards of ignoring power, and the
major impact it can have on optimal pipelining. The talk concludes with
speculations on further research opportunities in this area.

<font color=#ff0000>The Future of Electrical Backplanes: High-Speed at Low-Cost
</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
Backplanes contain a lot of interconnect to connect several system parts.
The required data bandwidth of interfaces within/between systems continues
to grow and therefore there is always a drive to increase backplane
communication speed. Sometimes the question is posed whether this type of
communication will be replaced by optical links soon.
<p>
This presentation shows that electrical is certainly not at its end of
life.  Proper signalling, transmission lines and characteristic design can
boost the performance to 10Gb/s/channel (and probably beyond). Furthermore
electrical has certainly a strong advance: low-cost. The presentation
discusses several bus and signalling concepts, shows problems and
limitations, but also solutions and opportunities for the future enabled
by technology improvements. Optical links seem not really competitive yet
for this kind of application. This brings up the conclusion that (new)
electrical links remain the preferred solution for the foreseeable future.

Abstract:
<p>
        Integrated circuit front ends are used extensively in both
research and commercial applications of radiation detectors. Examples
range from particle physics, where modern detectors involve tens of
millions of sensors accumulating data at rates of terabytes per second, to
handheld nuclear medicine probes used to guide surgery. Key circuit design
goals are: power-constrained front-end noise optimization, high precision
voltage and time measurements in a mixed-signal VLSI environment,
radiation tolerance, and high-density interconnect to the sensors. This
talk will describe some CMOS circuit techniques developed to achieve these
goals. The expected impact of CMOS scaling on future analog performance
will also be discussed.

Analog-to-Digital Converters
</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
Broadband wireless communication systems require high-speed, high-resolution
Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converters designed in digital CMOS process. One
such application in cellular base stations requires the A/D Converter to
digitize multiple channels at IF frequencies as high as 70 MHz with
resolutions greater than 13 bits. Multi-bit Pipelined architecture for
Analog-to-Digital conversion have been shown to provide high throughput at
low power consumption. However practical realizations of these converters in
digital CMOS process suffer from component mismatches, lower amplifier
gains, offsets and charge injection errors, limiting their linearity to 8-10
bits of resolution at sampling rates in only tens of MHz. Existing
Calibration Techniques to improve the resolution of the A/D Converters
suffer from several drawbacks.
<p>
This talk will focus on background calibration techniques to improve the
resolution of Pipelined Analog-to-Digital Converters in digital CMOS
process.  A general idea of the proposed technique is to adaptively correct
for systematic errors in pipelined A/D converter using a least mean squares
approach. The technique will be shown to achieve high linearity with minimal
real estate and power consumption.

<font color=#ff0000>Systems and Circuits for Integrated Wireless Receivers</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
The increasing demand for affordable and portable wireless communication
systems has motivated substantial research into the realization of
monolithic transceivers. The use of low-cost CMOS technology is of
particular interest since it provides the possibility of integrating analog
and digital circuitry on the same chip. Furthermore, the trend toward
shifting more complexity from the analog to the digital domain in favor of
robust and flexible performance, suggests more functionality should be
implemented in the digital domain. Of particular interest is channel
selection filtering, an essential function of any receiver. Also, the recent
surge in high-data-rate wireless applications (e.g. wireless local area
networks, multimedia) advocates the use of spectrally-efficient modulation
schemes.
<p>
In this talk, we start with a review of the classical and modern receiver
architectures suitable for a single-chip realization. Also, low-voltage
realizations of RF building blocks (low-noise amplifier and mixer) will be
discussed. Then, two research projects at the University of Toronto on a
low-cost CMOS wireless video communication system are highlighted.  First,
Hierarchical QAM, a new DC-free spectrally-efficient modulation scheme is
presented. Second, the realization of a delta-sigma decimation filter which
also performs as a channel selection and approximate root-Nyquist
pulse-shaping filter is described.

<p>
Abstract:
<p>
      Boolean Satisfiability is probably the most studied of combinatorial
optimization/search problems. Significant effort has been devoted to
trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem
instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design
Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study
has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both
proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find
significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete
solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this
talk I will describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff,
which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering
of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient
implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low
overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two
orders of magnitude performance improvement on difficult SAT benchmarks in
comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.
This is joint work with Matt Moskewicz, Conor Madigan, Ying Zhao and
Lintao Zhang.

<font color=#ff0000>Power-Aware Architectures</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
       Since power consumption is now a first-class design contraint,
"power-awareness" is a necessary aspect of modeling and design. This is
true for all stages of design and at all levels of abstraction. In this
talk, we will focus on power-aware design at the  microarchitecture
definition stage. We start by presenting our group's work on early-stage,
workload-driven power-performance modeling. Augmenting the current
architectural simulation tools to include energy behavior of the
unit-level components is the first step in conducting research in this
emerging new area. We also describe the model validation methods that we
are pursuing to understand the relative and absolute accuracy implications
of such early-stage models. In the second part of the talk, we describe
some of the specific power-aware microarchitecture ideas that we have
studied. We present simulation-based and analytical results to understand:
(a) the power-performance efficiency benefits of dynamic adaptation and
throttling of on-chip computing resources: e.g. issue queues and
instruction fetch bandwidth; (b) the fundamental limits of scaling within
a given microarchitectural paradigm: e.g. super scalar, with and without
simultaneous multithreading (SMT) as well as chip multiprocessing. We also
address the microarchitectural support issues for coarse- and fine-grain
clock gating as well as Vdd (power) gating; and, we project the effect of
such "gating" methods on power-performance scalability.

<p>
Abstract:
<p>                Designing CMOS devices for high-performance servers has always
been a challenge. Scaling devices to keep up with the higher performance
Moore's Law demands from each generation has already forced gate lengths
below 0.1um and gate oxides below 1.5nm, so ever more creative methods of
technology improvement -- beyond simple scaling -- are needed.  To face
this challenge, IBM has been a leader in introducing many new materials,
such as Cu wires and SiLK(TM) low-K intermetal dielectric, and new
technologies, such as SOI and strained-Si.  This talk will cover many of
these technologies, and how they affect the device designers task,
particularly focusing on SOI CMOS design.  In addition, the rise of the
internet, high-speed networking, and mobile computing have introduced a
new set of requirements for semiconductor technologies.  Various
extensions of SOI CMOS that attempt to meet these needs, such as adding
devices optimized for RF or low-power performance, as well as embedding
DRAM into SOI logic processes, will also be touched on briefly.

<p>
Abstract:
<p>                A movement away from specialized bipolar process technology to
pure digital CMOS technology has characterized the last fifteen years of
analog IC design. Merged BiCMOS technology has not become a mainstream
option as a result of the high incremental process costs for the BiCMOS
devices. Challenging the analog designer is the fact that maximum
operating voltages have fallen concurrently with each smaller geometry
generation of core CMOS transistors. Designers have moved from a 10V
environment to a 3.3V environment with surprisingly little trouble. The
start of the new century brings new challenges as the maximum operating
voltage of 0.15u to 0.1u process technology has dramatically reduced to
1.5V - 1.0V.  At the same time, modular BiCMOS is evolving.  The costs of
these technologies, as a percentage of the total wafer cost, have declined
significantly.  Modular SiGe bipolar devices now challenge the performance
space once occupied only by GaAs. Copper interconnect systems, low k
dielectrics and modular substrate engineering offer, for the first time,
high Q passive inductors on chip.
<p>
        In this talk, we will examine the current process technology
options available to the analog designer and use our foggy crystal ball to
predict whether core digital CMOS or modular BiCMOS will emerge as the
mainstream choice for mixed-signal and RF chip designs in the early part
of this.

Abstract:
<p>
       In the decade before World War II, Black, Bode, and Nyquist put
the concept of feedback on a firm theoretical base that made highly
reliable, practical applications possible.  The impact of feedback is far
broader than how it transformed electrical engineering, both in what could
be accomplished and in how EEs are educated. Feedback is ubiquitous.  It
has influenced virtually every area of intellectual endeavor; it is
integral to the physical realization of nearly everything that comprises
today's information society. This talk begins to address several questions
concerning feedback.
        Among them are:<ol>
<li>        What were the earliest uses of feedback and why didn't these
lead to a more general usage?
<li>        What was the reaction to Black's amplifier proposal?
<li>        What are some of the implications of the concept of

<font color=#ff0000>Training the Next Generation RF Circuit Designer: Education and Research</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
  The field of radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) design is
currently enjoying a renaissance, driven by the explosive growth in
wireless applications.Because of this sudden and unexpected growth, there
has been a frenzied scramble to train RF engineers to meet the high
demand. A major challenge in this task is that RF design is 
multidisciplinary in nature, requiring knowledge of communications
and signal propagation theory, transceiver architectures, and circuit design.
To address the education and research issues associated with the demand,this 
talk will present an intensive first-year graduate course designed
specifically to produce competent RFIC designers in one year along with
onging research conducted in the Cornell Broadband Communications Research
Lab (CBCRL).

<font color=#ff0000>A "Divide and Conquer" Technique for the Design     
        of  Wide Dynamic Range Continuous Time Filters.</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
        This work presents a novel technique for the design of continuous
time analog filters with high dynamic range and low power dissipation. The
essence of the method is to break up the required dynamic range of the
filter in smaller ranges, and utilize separate filters in each one of
them. This is done in such a way that the output is not disturbed whenever
a different filter takes over. Very serious power dissipation and chip
area savings will be shown to result from this technique.

<font color=#ff0000>Practical HP and Notch Gm-(grounded)C Biquads:<br> 
         How many Different Topologies are there?</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
 Over the last twenty years numerous studies dealing with
Gm-(grounded)C biquad filter design have been published. While each of
these fine publications provides a "good set" of filter topologies none of
them seems to clearly identify the "complete set".
<p>
 In this talk I will derive the "complete set" of practical HP and
notch biquad topologies. The result of this derivation is quite
unexpected: there are only five distinct topologies (two notches and three
HP). Two of them require precise Gm matching while the other three do not.

<font color=#FF0000>An Injection-Locking Scheme for Precision Quadrature Generation</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
A quadrature "splitter" assumes a reference clock at frequency
f_in, f_min <= f_in <= f_max. The output is two equal-amplitude signals
c(t) and s(t) both periodic with frequency f_in but spaced exactly
one-quarter of a period apart: i.e., c(t) = s(t+T/4), T=1/f_in. Such a
quadrature pair can be used, for example, to generate single sideband
modulation. The suppression of the undesired sideband depends directly on
the accuracy of the quadrature signals. We describe such a scheme, which
injection-locks a cascade of ring oscillators in such a manner as to
generate extremely accurate quadrature for f_in in excess of 2GHz with a
tuning range of at least 100MHz.  Our scheme places no requirements on the
waveform of the reference clock.  Simulation and preliminary experimental
data confirm our claims of quadrature accuracy on the order of 0.1 degrees
of phase. When used for a SSB modulator, this implies suppression of the
undesired sideband by at least 50dB.
<p>
Injection-locking is related to but distinct from phase locking.
In particular, there is no requirement for a low-pass "loop" filter, hence
no issue of loop stability. A brief discussion of the theory of
injection-locking will be presented.

<font color=#FF0000>Recent Advances in Logic Verification</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
 Logic verification continues to be considered one of CAD`s most
 difficult problems, highlighted with the discovery of the Pentium
 bug dilemma. This talk reviews certain current innovations
 addressing such problems. A new method will be discussed, based
 on what has become known as Recursive Learning Technique. This
 proposed technique has its cornerstone in Boolean implication techniques --
 proven most powerful when traditional approaches such as OBDD fail.
 In fact, Recursive Learning was the first to verify the ISCAS benchmark
 circuits -- discovering some bugs in the process. This work has won
 the l996 IEEE Transactions on CAD/Best Paper Award, patented that
 same year. Several CAD companies currently implement this technique
 in their tool.

<font color=#FF0000>Phase noise mechanisms in LC-tuned oscillators</font>
<p>
Abstract:
<p>
        The problem of the evaluation of phase noise in integrated
LC-oscillators is discussed. We show that is possible to obtain a simple
expression for the output phase noise that takes into account the circuit
non-linearities, avoiding the use of "black box" simulators. Using simple
physical arguments, supported by experimental data, we show that some
upconversion mechanism usually neglected, as those arising from indirect
stability or from AM/PM conversion, may be instead dominant and invalidate
the noise vs. power trade-off. These considerations will be applied to the
design of two circuits: a 2.5 GHz bipolar oscillator with an Automatic
Amplitude Control loop, and a 5 GHz CMOS oscillator for Bluetooth
standard.
