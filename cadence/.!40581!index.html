<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>EE4303
<br>Analog Integrated Circuit Design
<br>This course focuses on analog IC design - design of building blocks like operational
amplifiers, feedback, oscillators, voltage controlled oscillators, phase locked loops etc.
Extensive use of CAD tools in Columbia's environment will be required.
<p>EE4304
<br>Analog Circuits and Systems in VLSI
<br>This course focuses more on A/D converters and switched capacitor circuit design.
<p>EE4321
<br><a href="../courses/fall-2003/ee4321/">VLSI Circuits</a>
<br>This course is an introduction to the design of integrated circuits in leading-edge
CMOS technology.  Full-custom design
techniques as applied to digital integrated circuits are the emphasis.  
The course culminates in a ``mini-design" project, a
simple 8-bit microcontroller core, implemented in a TSMC 0.25um process. 
Extensive use of the CAD tools in Columbia's
environment will be required. 
<p>
<BR>EE4332
<BR>Digital VLSI Lab
<BR>Design of a large scale, digital, or analog MOS integrated circuit.
Project circuits are fabricated and tested in following term. Lectures
cover use of computer-aided design tools and study of some sample VLSI
circuits.
<p>EE4340
<BR><a href="../courses/spring-2004/ee4340/">Computer Hardware Design</a>
<BR>VHDL tools are used to design a PDP/8 Computer. Homework and Lab assignments
and Midterm.

<p>EE6312
<BR><a href="http://www.cisl.columbia.edu/~ee6312/">Advanced Analog Integrated Circuits</a>
<BR>This course focuses on CMOS analog circuit design. MOS operation in weak, moderate and strong inversion; transistor stages with low voltage supplies; IC single ended and fully differential operational amplifier design and analysis are discussed.
Switched capacitor techniques, stability and frequency compensation techniques, noise in circuits and temperature and supply independent biasing techniques are discussed. At the end of the course there is a design project. Cadence tools are used extensively throughout the course.

<p>EE6930
<br><a href="../courses/spring-2002/ee6930/">Advanced Digital Electronic Circuits</a>
<br>This course focuses on full-custom circuit design techniques for high-performance, 
low-power digital integrated circuits at
the leading-edge of scaled CMOS technology. There will be several ``mini-design" 
projects integrated into the course in
addition to traditional problem sets. Extensive use of the CAD tools in Columbia's 
environment will be required.
