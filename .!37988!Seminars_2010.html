					Addressing the Thermal and Power Challenges of Tera-Scale Computing
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b>
Power and temperature are major physical challenges that need to be addressed in current and future computing systems.
In this talk three synergistic techniques will be presented to address these challenges, including:
<br>(1) Thermal characterization techniques to identify the locations of temperature hot spots in real processors, and to use these locations to drive an optimal thermal sensor allocation technique.
<br>(2) Dynamic thermal management techniques for multi-core processors where the performance of a real processor is optimally adapted depending on thermal slack measured by the thermal sensors during runtime.
<br>(3) Post-silicon power modeling techniques where accurate spatial power estimates for various circuit blocks are computed using the measured thermal infrared emissions from the backside of the die.
In addition, the experimental techniques required for infrared imaging and power acquisition of real systems will be overviewed. Our current research on devising improved energy-proportional computing systems for data centers will be also overviewed.
