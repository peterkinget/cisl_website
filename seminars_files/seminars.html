Beyond CMOS Scaling: What's a Circuit Designer to Do?
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
As decades of sustained CMOS technology scaling begins to slow, the silicon microelectronics industry must look to new, innovative techniques to improve performance and power efficiency. To build the next generation of computing systems, today's circuit designer must understand not only the possibilities of new, emerging technologies, but also how system architecture can be changed to meet the evolving needs of the end-user. Such blurring of the boundaries between devices, circuits, and systems as well as those between digital, mixed-signal, and analog circuits will be essential in future research work. Exemplary directions will be discussed to show that there is much exciting work to be done in the circuits field beyond CMOS scaling and its traditional focus on digital logic performance. In computing systems as we know them today, there is yet significant room to improve the efficiency of system subcomponents such as embedded memory and power delivery/management. Going forward, there may be even more room to develop new circuits that are radically more efficient by invoking architectural changes in parallelism, accelerators, and heterogeneous systems to serve future applications needs.<br><br>

					<b>Biography:</b><br>

Leland Chang received the BS, MS, and PhD degrees in EECS from UC Berkeley, where his work focused on early demonstration of the FinFET transistor structure for CMOS scaling. He joined IBM in 2003 and soon realized that embedded memory was just as important as (if not more so than) logic computation. Masquerading as an array designer, he demonstrated 6T-SRAM cells scaled to record sizes, 8T-SRAM for voltage scalability, and double-pumped register files for density and fast latency. More recently, he has worked to improve his analog design skills by developing on-chip voltage regulators based on new integrated passives while keeping his digital design skills in check while studying low voltage applications. Day to day, he splits time between managing a technology group that dabbles all too often in circuits and systems, pursuing the never-ending quest for power efficiency in high performance systems, and keeping pace with the ISSCC technical program committee.

Pushing the limits of terahertz optoelectronics
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>

Although unique potentials of terahertz waves for chemical identification, material characterization, biological
sensing, and medical imaging have been recognized for quite a while, the relatively poor performance, higher
costs, and bulky nature of current terahertz systems continue to impede their deployment in field settings. In
this talk, I will describe some of our recent results on developing fundamentally new terahertz
electronic/optoelectronic components and imaging/spectrometry architectures to mitigate performance
limitations of existing terahertz systems.

In specific, I will introduce new designs of high-performance photoconductive terahertz sources that utilize
plasmonic antennas to offer terahertz radiation at record-high power levels of several tens of milliwatts - demonstrating more than three orders of magnitude increase compared to the state of the art. I will describe
that the unique capabilities of these plasmonic antennas can be further extended to develop terahertz detectors
and heterodyne spectrometers with single-photon detection sensitivities over a broad terahertz bandwidth at
room temperatures, which has not been possible through existing technologies. To achieve this significant
performance improvement, plasmonic antennas and device architectures are optimized for operation at
telecommunication wavelengths, where very high power, narrow linewidth, wavelength tunable, compact and
cost-effective optical sources are commercially available. Therefore, our results pave the way to compact and
low-cost terahertz sources, detectors, and spectrometers that could offer numerous opportunities for e.g.,
medical imaging and diagnostics, atmospheric sensing, pharmaceutical quality control, and security screening
systems. And finally, I will briefly highlight our research activities on development of new types of high-
performance terahertz passive components (e.g., modulators, tunable filters, and beam deflectors) based on
novel reconfigurable meta-films.

Passive Mixer Transparency and Its Implications for Software Defined Radio Receivers
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>Software defined radios (SDR) aim to make every critical parameter of a radio's function adjustable and configurable through digital control, without significantly degrading performance.  In this talk I will discuss a recently (re)discovered approach to achieving such flexibility, by exploiting the transparency properties of multi-phase CMOS passive mixers. Such mixers, combined with appropriate baseband circuitry, can be used to synthesize arbitrary in-band impedance and filtering properties and up-convert them to their RF port.  Such mixers also display unusually high out-of band linearity and surprisingly low in-band noise, making them an intriguing option for SDR receivers.  I will discuss some of the fundamental theory and associated limits of such receivers, as well as enhancements to this architecture, and other applications of the mixer transparency.<br><br>

direct-conversion receiver for the GSM cellular standard.  That chip, and subsequent variants, have sold in excess of 100 million parts.  Starting
graduate school at U.C. Berkeley in 2001, Molnar worked on an early, ultra-low-power radio transceiver for wireless sensor networks, and then
joined a retinal neurophysiology group where he worked on dissecting the structure and function of neural circuits in the mammalian retina.  He
joined the Faculty at Cornell University in 2007, and presently works on low-power software-defined radios, neural interface circuits, and new
integrated imaging techniques.  He is recipient of the DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2010, NSF CAREER Award in 2012, and ISSCC Lewis Winner Award in
2012.

Revolutionizing Medical Device Design (Co-sponsored by IEEE NY EDS/SSCS)
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The vision of the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center (MEDRC) is to facilitate the microelectronics and medical device industry in the transformation of medical electronic devices as it has successfully demonstrated in computation, communication and consumer electronics. The successful realization of such a vision also demands innovations in the usability and productivity of medical devices, and new technologies and approaches to manufacture devices. Information technology is a critical component of the intelligence that will enhance the usability of devices; real-time image and signal processing combined with intelligent computer systems will enhance the practitioners' diagnostic intuition. All of the key ingredients are in place at MIT and in Cambridge and Boston. The leadership of MEDRC has had strong industry interaction for over twenty-five years. The MIT research portfolio includes low power integrated circuits and systems, micro electro-mechanical systems, bioelectronics, sensors and microfluidics which are world leading by any measure. The medical researchers and clinicians at world-renowned hospitals located within a mile of MIT, provide the patient settings to prove the efficacy of innovative devices. In this talk I will introduce the research directions of the MEDRC and discuss the circuit and system issues for a wearable vital signs monitors and for portable medical ultrasound imaging as applied to non-invasive intracranial pressure measurements.<br><br>

Circuits and Architectures for Power-Efficient High-Speed Electrical I/O 
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Advances in digital computing capabilities create higher demands for serial data transmission. Sustaining these bandwidth demands requires innovations on several fronts. Future packaging technologies must enable ultra-dense chip-to-chip interconnects. This in turn creates a need for compact, power-efficient I/O with equalization capable of supporting multi-Gb/s communication over these interconnects. In this talk, solutions to enable future electrical I/O bandwidth demands will be presented. After a brief overview of equalization techniques, design examples of equalizing receivers in 45nm SOI CMOS technologies will be shown, focusing on low-power circuits and architectures. Additionally, a compact 8x10-Gb/s I/O subsystem mounted to a silicon interposer via 50mm pitch "micro-C4" bumps will be described. The I/O includes a DFE-IIR equalizer in the receiver tailored for lossy silicon carrier interconnects, and bus-level redundancy that enables periodic recalibration of each serial link in a round-robin fashion. This work demonstrates the potential of silicon packaging technologies for achieving high bandwidth chip-to-chip communication by sending multi-Gb/s data over a large number of parallel interconnects, paving the way for increased module bandwidth for high-performance computing systems.

Parametric Excitation
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A time-varying capacitor embedded in suitable supporting circuitry
can be made to exhibit a negative resistance -- hence, can provide
gain, sustain an oscillation or convert energy from one frequency
to another -- all theoretically noise-free and with 100% efficiency
(because it is a lossless circuit element).Of course, there are some details and parasitic resistances degrade
the efficiency.
<br>
In this talk, I will survey some of the early history of such
parametric circuits, then show some modern circuit implementations
with possible applications to RFID tags or (very ambitious) a possible
replacement for the traveling-wave tube.
