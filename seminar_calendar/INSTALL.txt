-- INSTALL notes for awkiawki

0.) install HTTP-Server with CGI support (e.g. apache, thttpd)

1.) copy awki.cgi and parse.awk to your cgi-bin/
    make sure both are executable for your Webserver (chmod ugo+x)

2.) check the shebang in the fist line of both scripts (#!/usr/bin/awk)
    and change to you local settings 
	(HINT: use mawk if available, it is faster)
	
3.) create ./data/ directory in your cgi-bin/
    make sure it is read- and writeable for awki.cgi
	
4.) copy awki.png to the root directory of your Webserver

5.) call http://localhost/cgi-bin/awki.cgi and edit your fist page to
    see if setup was successful

6.) have fun with awkiawki :)

For customization you can change the localconf variables in awki.cgi.
If you do so, pay attention to point 3 and 4.
