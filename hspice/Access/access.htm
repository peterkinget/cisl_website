<h3 align="center">Getting Access to Computers Running HSPICE</h3>

<p>To run HSPICE, you will need an account on the SUN workstations that are located in

S.W. Mudd 12xx.&nbsp; 

<p>Of logistic reasons, you will not have physical access to the SUN

workstations.&nbsp; Hence, to use HSPICE, you must have physical access to another

networked computer with an X interface.&nbsp; You may, e.g., use your CUNIX

account (<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/accounts/create/" target="_top">obtain

one here</a>) and the facilities provided in the computer lab located in S.W.

Mudd room 251.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may use the ILAB computers located on

the 12th floor in S.W. Mudd, but for those you will need a separate account.</p>

<p>To use HSPICE through an X interface, you must complete the

following steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Log in on your local (physical access) computer and start a regular X

    terminal (xterm). </li>

  <li>Choose from <a href="names.htm"> this list</a> a remote computer that has HSPICE installed.&nbsp;

    In the following we will assume that the computer's name is <font face="Courier New">name.cisl.columbia.edu</font> </li>

  <li>Allow the remote computer to display windows on the local computer's

    terminal:&nbsp; This

    is done by issuing in the xterm on the local computer the following command:

    <p><font face="Courier New">xhost +name.cisl.columbia.edu</font> </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Start a ssh session to the remote computer.&nbsp; This is done by

    issuing in the xterm the following command:

    <p><font face="Courier New">ssh login@name.cisl.columbia.edu</font> </p>

    <p>and when prompted providing your password for the remote

    computer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</li>

  <li>If this is the first time you log in on any of the SUN workstations, you

    should change your initial password.&nbsp; This is done by issuing the

    following command:

    <p><font face="Courier New">passwd</font></p>

    <p>and answering the questions when prompted .</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Now you need to inform the remote computer where it should dispIay any

  windows through the X interface. 

  Let <font face="Courier New">local.computer.name</font> be the

  computer at which you are sitting.

  You need to set the environment variable $DISPLAY

    to <font face="Courier New">local.computer.name:0. </font>How to

    do this depends on which shell you are running on the remote computer.&nbsp; If you have a

    preference for not running the so-called &quot;tcsh&quot; shell, you

    probably already know how to do this in your preferred shell.&nbsp;

    Otherwise I suggest that you use tsch.&nbsp; This is done by issuing the

    following two commands:

    <p><font face="Courier New">/usr/bin/tcsh</font></p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">setenv DISPLAY local.computer.name:0</font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</li>

</ol>

Now you should be able to use the remote computer almost as if you were

    sitting in front of it.&nbsp; Continue by completing the <a href="../Tutorial/tutorial.htm">tutorial</a>.
