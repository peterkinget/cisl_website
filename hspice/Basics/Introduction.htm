<p>SPICE is a general purpose analog circuit simulator

that is used to verify circuit designs and to predict circuit behavior. This

is of particular importance for <u>integrated circuits</u>. It was for this

reason that SPICE was originally developed at the Electronics Research

Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley (1975), as its name

implies:&nbsp;</p>

</font>HSPICE is a commercial and very powerful version of SPICE that has fewer

bugs than&nbsp; the freely available Berkeley SPICE.&nbsp; HSPICE is a relatively

comprehensive program that can be used to simulate very large circuits comprising many

different types of components.&nbsp; HSPICE is

able to handle hierarchical circuit structures (i.e., you can define subcircuits)

and supports both local and global variables/parameters.



<p><b><i>Circuit analyses</i></b> supported by HSPICE:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>

Non-linear DC analysis: calculates the DC transfer curves from any input

to any output.

<li>

Non-linear transient analysis: calculates the voltages and currents as a

function of time when a signal is applied.

<li>

Linear AC Analysis: calculates the frequency response from the input to

all specified node voltages and currents. Bode plots can be generated

using a graphical post processor, such as AWAVES.

<li>

Noise analysis

<li>

Sensitivity analysis

<li>

Distortion analysis

<li>

Fourier analysis: calculates and plots the frequency spectrum.

<li>

Monte Carlo Analysis

</ul>
