<p>

The HSPICE source file consists of five parts.

<ol>

  <li><i><u>Title statement</u></i>: the first line is the circuit's title; it

    may be anything, but not neglected.</li>

  <li><i><u>Data statements</u></i>: description of the components and the

    interconnections.</li>

  <li><i><u>Control statements</u></i>: tells SPICE what type of analysis to

    perform on the circuit.

  <li><i><u>Output statements</u></i>: specifies what outputs are to be printed

    or plotted.</li>

  <li><i><u>End statement</u></i>: on the very last line: .END followed by a

    carriage return.</li>

</ol>

Although statements 2,3, and 4 may appear in any order, it is recommended that

they be given in the above sequence.&nbsp;

<dl>

  <dt>&nbsp;

  <dt><tt>TITLE STATEMENT</tt></dt>

  <dt><tt>ELEMENT STATEMENTS</tt>

  <dt><tt>.</tt>

  <dt><tt>.</tt>

  <dt><tt>COMMAND (CONTROL) STATEMENTS</tt>

  <dt><tt>OUTPUT STATEMENTS</tt>

  <dt><tt>.END &lt;CR&gt;</tt><br>

    &nbsp;

</dl>

<p>You can insert <u><i>comment statements</i></u> anywhere in the source file:</p>

<ul>

<li>

"*" - indicates a full line comment

<li>

"$" - indicates an end-of-line comment

</ul>

<p>Furthermore, it is useful to know that:</p>

<ul>

<li>	

"+" - indicates a continuation of the previous line.

</ul>



<p>An example of these statements can be found in the BJT amplifier example <a href="../ExampleFiles/bjtamp.sp"><i>bjtamp.sp</i></a>.

Here the .OPTION command is extended for four lines and the end of line comment

is used after the .MEASURE commands. Notice that by using tabs for the elements

and their nodes, it makes the netlist much easier to read. It is not required

that tabs be used, but it is very helpful.</p>

<h3><u>NOTATION</u></h3>

<p>HSPICE notation is relatively simple. Both upper and lower case letters are

allowed, but no distinction is made (HSPICE converts everything to upper-case

characters before any interpretation is attempted). The statements have a

free format and consist of fields separated by a blank. Each line is

interpreted as a separate statement, i.e., unless "+" is the first

character (see above).</p>

<ol>

  <li>All statements beginning with a "." are commands (e.g. .OPTION,

   .PRINT, .AC, etc.) Commands are used to change the behavior of

   HSPICE:

   <ul>

   <li>	   

   Request that a specific type of simulation be performed (.AC, .DC,

   .TRAN, .FOUR, etc.)

   <li>

   Set various parameters, such as voltage or charge accuracy (.OPTION)

   <li>

   Specify what circuit nodes that are of interest (.PRINT, .PLOT, etc.)

   </ul>

  <li>Statements that begin with an alphabetic character are treated as elements

    (e.g. r51, cc, load, etc).&nbsp; The first character determines the type of

    element:

    <ul>

    <li>

    R for resistors: (R1, Rload, Rin, Rcapacitor, Rdummy, Rain, etc.)

    <li>

    C for capacitors: (C1, Cload, Cin, Csomename, Cinductor, Cello, etc.)

    <li>

    L for inductors: (L1, Lload, Lin, Lmutual, Ldummy, Larry, etc.)

    <li>

    D for diodes: (D1, Dummy, Dsubstrate, etc.)

    <li>

    Q for bipolar junction transistors (Q1, Q32apq, Qdiff1, Question,

    etc.)

    <li>

    M for MOS transistors (M1, M12, Mary, Mozart, etc.)

    <li>

    V for voltage sources

    <li>

    I for current sources

    <li>

    G for voltage-controlled current sources (transconductance amplifiers)

    <li>

    F for current-controlled current sources (current amplifiers)

    <li>

    E for voltage-controlled voltage sources (voltage amplifiers)

    <li>

    H for current-controlled voltage sources (transresistance amplifiers)

    <li>

    X for subcircuits (hierarchical circuit structure)

    </ul>

</ol>

<p>Each element is subject to a specific notation.&nbsp; See [<a href="Commands.htm">Commands</a>]

and [<a href="Devices/Devices.htm">Devices</a>] for details.</p>

<h3><a name="top">Topology Rules:</a></h3>

HSPICE will (fortunately) only run if the circuit topology fulfill certain

criteria. Mostly, these criteria are the same as those known from basic

circuit analysis:

<ul>

<li>	

Every node must have a DC path to ground.

<li>

No dangling nodes (i.e. all nodes must have at least two connections).

<li>

No loops of only ideal voltage sources and capacitors.

<li>

No nodes connected to only ideal current sources and inductors.

</ul>



<h3><a name="name">Naming conventions:</a></h3>

</font>Every node and element within the HSPICE netlist must have its own unique

name. You are advised to use the following rules (although they are not strictly

necessary):

<ul>

<li>	

Node Identification:

<ul>

	<li>

	0 is ALWAYS ground

	<li>

	To avoid an old bug, it is best to start all node names (besides

	ground) with an alphabetic character (in1, in2, out1, out2, 

	n1, n2, n3,

	n4, etc.)

</ul>

<li>

Allowable Characters and Conventions:

<ul>

	<li>

	Max of 16 characters (warning: the rest are silently ignored)

	<li>

	May contain: +-*/:;$#.[]!&lt;&gt;_%&nbsp; 

	(but it is better not to use them)

	<li>

	May not contain: (),=&lt;space&gt;

</ul>

</ul> 

    

<h3><a name="units">HSPICE units:</a></h3>

HSPICE will automatically assign ohms to resistors, Farads to capacitors, and

Henries to inductors. Hence, you need only provide the numeric value.

<p>The scaling for the all units in HSPICE is done by:

<ul>

	<li>F=1e-15

	<li>P=1e-12

	<li>N=1e-9

	<li>U=1e-6

	<li>M=1e-3 ***************

	<li>K=1e3

	<li>MEG=X=1e6 **************

	<li>G=1e9

	<li>T=1e12

</ul>



Note: Capitals do not matter (e.g. F=f and M=m), therefore many people have

problems with M and MEG. Please be careful with these two units!&nbsp; Of this

reason, I personally never use any of these abbreviations; I prefer the

floating-point notation: 1.234e5=0.1234e6.



<h3><a name="glob">Global Variables (advanced subject):</a></h3>

<ul>

	<li>Syntax

	<ul>

		<li>.GLOBAL node1 node2 node3 .........Globally defined nodes

		<li>.GLOBAL VBIAS VCC .................Globally defined sources

	</ul>

	<li>Usage

	<ul>

		<li>When subcircuits are included in the data file.

		<li>Assigns common node name to subcircuit nodes

		<li>Power supply connection of all subcirsuits is often

		done this way:

		<ul>

			<li>.GLOBAL VCC:

			Connects all nodes named VCC 

			(all circuits have a common node)

		</ul>

	</ul>



</ul>

Essentially globals are used most often for subcircuits, though they are great

for sources. This way all power sources do not have to be separately defined.

Notice that ground (node 0) always is a global node.
