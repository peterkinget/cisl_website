<p>

There are two main hints to keep in mind when using HSPICE, they are:

<ol>

  <li>Know what to expect from the simulation BEFORE running it!!!

  <li>Simulation is NO substitute for <b>THINKING</b>.</li>

</ol>

Even though these hints are not always followed, they are good guidlines to use.

For instance, if you run a simulation on a circuit that you know has a gain of

around 100db and get 1db, it is easily to assume that an error exists in the

netlist of the circuit. On the other hand, if a result of 1db is returned and

the actual is not known, it can easily be assumed to be correct when an error

actually exits in the netlist!!

<p>

<h3>Basic Strategy:</h3>



<p>

Even if you don't go through the entire help website, make sure you get

an understanding of how to write basic netlists. Here is a guideline

that you could follow:

<ul>

	<li>

	First line has to be the title.

	<li>

	The second line could be:<br>

	.OPTIONS post<br>

	This will make sure that you get the plots in awaves.

	<li>

	Draw the circuit on a piece of paper. Name the nodes. The ground

	terminal has to be named "0". Write down

	the netlist in any order in the following manner:<br>

	<ul>

		<li>

		For resistors:<br>

		Rname terminal1 terminal2 Rvalue

		<li>

		For capacitors:<br>

		Cname terminal1 terminal2 Cvalue

		<li>

		For inductors:<br>

		Lname terminal1 terminal2 Lvalue

		<li>

		For MOSFETS:<br>

		Mname drain gate source body Modelname L=length W=width

		<li>

		For voltage/current sources:<br>

		Study the section on 

		<a href="Devices/Devices.htm#sou">voltage and current

			sources</a>. 

	</ul>

	<li>

	Typically you will be doing DC or transient or AC simulations.

	Study the <a href="Commands.htm#DC Statement">.DC</a>,

	<a href="Commands.htm#Transient">.TRAN</a> and 

	<a href="Commands.htm#AC Statement">.AC</a> statements.

	<li>

	If you had a MOSFET, put the model statement. PMOS and NMOS

	transistors have separate models. The course TA will provide you

	with the model, if you should require one.

	<li>

	Write <a href="Commands#Output">.PLOT and/or .PRINT</a> statements here.

	<li>

	The last line should be .END. Add a linefeed (enter) after that.

</ul>

<h3>Other helpful hints:</h3>

<ol>

  <li>

  You can measure the voltage at any node, or the voltage between any

  two nodes. However, you can only measure the current passing through a

  voltage source. To measure a current through a branch, insert a dummy

  voltage source of value 0 in that branch (like an ammeter) and measure the current

  through this dummy voltage source.

  <li>It is not required to use one of HSPICE's graphing programs. One of the

    most common ways is to extract the graphing data from the <i>.lis</i> file

    using scripts and then use <b>Matlab</b> to graph the data. To

    extract the data from the <i>.lis</i> file, have .PRINT statements.

    Use ".OPTIONS ingold" so that the data is in the exponent notation.

    Just edit the <i>.lis</i> file that you get to have the data

    suitable for <b>Matlab</b>.</li>
