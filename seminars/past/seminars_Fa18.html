Coherent Hybrid Massive MIMO for Advanced 4G/5G Radio Access Networks

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Recently, experts in academia and industry have been strongly advocating the concept of Massive MIMO for application in 4G and 5G systems. While the push for larger base station antenna aperture is likely the right idea for cellular and other applications, there are important subtleties, which make the �practical application of Massive MIMO far from straightforward. The original version of this concept requires digitization of every antenna element and evades the need of RF coherency by using pilot signals and extensive digital signal processing. This brute force approach results in expensive and power hungry systems with performance, which is highly sensitive to practical impairments. In this presentation we show that by introducing economical RF coherency, i.e., by designing the Massive MIMO
system on a low-cost phase-array platform, the radio hardware can be simplified significantly without fundamental loss of performance and with improved resilience to practical impairments. We will describe the Blue Danube hybrid solution to Coherent Massive MIMO and will present field results from Blue Danube products operating in mid-band spectrum.

Computing with Dynamical Systems 

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Collective dynamical systems offer unique opportunities for computing by harnessing the complex interactions of simple elements such as oscillators or spike generators. This is possible, when such dynamics can be programmed, controlled, and observed. In this talk, I will present some of our work where we are exploring the time-evolution of both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems in both CMOS and post-CMOS computing substrates. I will show applications of such systems in solving inverse problems, distributed optimizations (convex and combinatorial) and machine learning. In particular, I will discuss our recent work that connects dynamics and algebraic graph theory. Finally I will talk about implementation of such dynamics in mixed-signal CMOS, including a recent demonstration of reinforcement learning for energy-constrained edge devices. I will conclude with a brief discussion of the opportunities, potentials and challenges in realizing such computational systems.

Next Generation GaN-based Materials, Devices, and Integration for Microwave and Millimeter Wave Applications 


</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Advances in silicon technology continue to revolutionize microelectronics. However, Si cannot do everything, particularly for high performance, high frequency RF and mixed signal applications. As a result circuits based on other materials systems, such as III-N semiconductors, are required. In fact, GaN RF technology is beginning to become the technology of choice for next generation microwave and millimeter applications. In addition, recent research in nitride
material and device engineering show promise of significantly increased RF performance (power density, gain, efficiency, operating frequency) over conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Despite these advances nitride device technologies do not enjoy the integration density, cost benefit and manufacturing infrastructure of Si. So how can we get the &apos;best of both worlds&apos;? What is the best way to integrate III-Ns with Si? In this presentation, we review the status of and recent advances in III-N RF device technology as well as different heterogeneous integration approaches and summarize our results on the successful wafer-scale, 3D heterogeneous integration (3DHI) of GaN HEMTs and Si CMOS.

Flexible Radios and Flexible Networks

<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Over the past decades the world has become increasingly connected, with communications driving bothmarkets and social movements.� Low power electronics, efficient communications, and better battery technology have all contributed to this revolution, but the cost and power required for these systems must be pushed further to make cheap, ubiquitous, seamless communication accessible to a wider community.�� In this talk I will discuss two engineering approaches to this problem.� I will look at various approaches to drive the power down in radio networks that span across circuits and systems.� I will also look at creative biologically inspired approaches to enabling very low power networks and IoT.� Finally, I will discuss how by adding flexibility and building reconfigurable hardware, we can likewise build lower power and less costly consumer systems that can adapt across protocols and networks and work under changing device technologies.

Image Rejection Theory and Mitigation Approaches

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

This seminar will review the problem of image rejection in wireless receivers and discuss the numerous approaches to mitigate its effect. Classical super-heterodyne receivers achieve image rejection with high-selectivity front-end RF tracking filters and careful choice of the IF frequency. In contrast, modern Integrated Circuit CMOS receivers typically use a low-IF complex architecture and either have a one-time calibration with a test signal or an autonomous DSP-based calibration that continuously adapts in the background to reject the image. Several examples are presented of the various approaches. The talk
will emphasize an image cancellation technique that downconverts both the desired and image channel to baseband and uses a LMS-based signal separation algorithm. Simulation and experimental results will be presented.
