<FONT color=#ff0000>Analog and RF Design in a
                    Deep Submicron CMOS World</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>                A movement away from specialized bipolar process technology to
pure digital CMOS technology has characterized the last fifteen years of
analog IC design. Merged BiCMOS technology has not become a mainstream
option as a result of the high incremental process costs for the BiCMOS
devices. Challenging the analog designer is the fact that maximum
operating voltages have fallen concurrently with each smaller geometry
generation of core CMOS transistors. Designers have moved from a 10V
environment to a 3.3V environment with surprisingly little trouble. The
start of the new century brings new challenges as the maximum operating
voltage of 0.15u to 0.1u process technology has dramatically reduced to
1.5V - 1.0V.  At the same time, modular BiCMOS is evolving.  The costs of
these technologies, as a percentage of the total wafer cost, have declined
significantly.  Modular SiGe bipolar devices now challenge the performance
space once occupied only by GaAs. Copper interconnect systems, low k
dielectrics and modular substrate engineering offer, for the first time,
high Q passive inductors on chip.
<P>
        In this talk, we will examine the current process technology
options available to the analog designer and use our foggy crystal ball to
predict whether core digital CMOS or modular BiCMOS will emerge as the
mainstream choice for mixed-signal and RF chip designs in the early part
of this.

<P>
Abstract:
<P>   This talk will start with a brief overview of the challenges in
  embedded SoC design.  We will then describe some work with
  Jason Fritts to evaluate programmable architectures for single-chip
  video processors. We performed a large number of experiments
  using the MediaBench benchmarks to evaluate VLIW and
  superscalar processors' performance on media processing.
  These experiments helped us determine the effectiveness of
  a number of architectural features for media processing.

<FONT color=#ff0000>THREE WHO MADE A REVOLUTION</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
       In the decade before World War II, Black, Bode, and Nyquist put
the concept of feedback on a firm theoretical base that made highly
reliable, practical applications possible.  The impact of feedback is far
broader than how it transformed electrical engineering, both in what could
be accomplished and in how EEs are educated. Feedback is ubiquitous.  It
has influenced virtually every area of intellectual endeavor; it is
integral to the physical realization of nearly everything that comprises
today's information society. This talk begins to address several questions
concerning feedback.
        Among them are:<OL>
<LI>        What were the earliest uses of feedback and why didn't these
lead to a more general usage?
<LI>        What was the reaction to Black's amplifier proposal?
<LI>        What are some of the implications of the concept of
feedback?</OL>
        The talk concludes with an idea of how "classical" feedback
analysis is readily implemented with modern computer-aided techniques

<FONT color=#ff0000>Training the Next Generation RF Circuit Designer: Education and Research</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
  The field of radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) design is
currently enjoying a renaissance, driven by the explosive growth in
wireless applications.Because of this sudden and unexpected growth, there
has been a frenzied scramble to train RF engineers to meet the high
demand. A major challenge in this task is that RF design is 
multidisciplinary in nature, requiring knowledge of communications
and signal propagation theory, transceiver architectures, and circuit design.
To address the education and research issues associated with the demand,this 
talk will present an intensive first-year graduate course designed
specifically to produce competent RFIC designers in one year along with
onging research conducted in the Cornell Broadband Communications Research
Lab (CBCRL).

<FONT color=#ff0000>A "Divide and Conquer" Technique for the Design     
        of  Wide Dynamic Range Continuous Time Filters.</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
        This work presents a novel technique for the design of continuous
time analog filters with high dynamic range and low power dissipation. The
essence of the method is to break up the required dynamic range of the
filter in smaller ranges, and utilize separate filters in each one of
them. This is done in such a way that the output is not disturbed whenever
a different filter takes over. Very serious power dissipation and chip
area savings will be shown to result from this technique.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Practical HP and Notch Gm-(grounded)C Biquads:<BR> 
         How many Different Topologies are there?</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
 Over the last twenty years numerous studies dealing with
Gm-(grounded)C biquad filter design have been published. While each of
these fine publications provides a "good set" of filter topologies none of
them seems to clearly identify the "complete set".
<P>
 In this talk I will derive the "complete set" of practical HP and
notch biquad topologies. The result of this derivation is quite
unexpected: there are only five distinct topologies (two notches and three
HP). Two of them require precise Gm matching while the other three do not.

<FONT color=#FF0000>An Injection-Locking Scheme for Precision Quadrature Generation</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
A quadrature "splitter" assumes a reference clock at frequency
f_in, f_min <= f_in <= f_max. The output is two equal-amplitude signals
c(t) and s(t) both periodic with frequency f_in but spaced exactly
one-quarter of a period apart: i.e., c(t) = s(t+T/4), T=1/f_in. Such a
quadrature pair can be used, for example, to generate single sideband
modulation. The suppression of the undesired sideband depends directly on
the accuracy of the quadrature signals. We describe such a scheme, which
injection-locks a cascade of ring oscillators in such a manner as to
generate extremely accurate quadrature for f_in in excess of 2GHz with a
tuning range of at least 100MHz.  Our scheme places no requirements on the
waveform of the reference clock.  Simulation and preliminary experimental
data confirm our claims of quadrature accuracy on the order of 0.1 degrees
of phase. When used for a SSB modulator, this implies suppression of the
undesired sideband by at least 50dB.
<P>
Injection-locking is related to but distinct from phase locking.
In particular, there is no requirement for a low-pass "loop" filter, hence
no issue of loop stability. A brief discussion of the theory of
injection-locking will be presented.

<FONT color=#FF0000>Recent Advances in Logic Verification</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
 Logic verification continues to be considered one of CAD`s most
 difficult problems, highlighted with the discovery of the Pentium
 bug dilemma. This talk reviews certain current innovations
 addressing such problems. A new method will be discussed, based
 on what has become known as Recursive Learning Technique. This
 proposed technique has its cornerstone in Boolean implication techniques --
 proven most powerful when traditional approaches such as OBDD fail.
 In fact, Recursive Learning was the first to verify the ISCAS benchmark
 circuits -- discovering some bugs in the process. This work has won
 the l996 IEEE Transactions on CAD/Best Paper Award, patented that
 same year. Several CAD companies currently implement this technique
 in their tool.

<FONT color=#FF0000>Phase noise mechanisms in LC-tuned oscillators</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
        The problem of the evaluation of phase noise in integrated
LC-oscillators is discussed. We show that is possible to obtain a simple
expression for the output phase noise that takes into account the circuit
non-linearities, avoiding the use of "black box" simulators. Using simple
physical arguments, supported by experimental data, we show that some
upconversion mechanism usually neglected, as those arising from indirect
stability or from AM/PM conversion, may be instead dominant and invalidate
the noise vs. power trade-off. These considerations will be applied to the
design of two circuits: a 2.5 GHz bipolar oscillator with an Automatic
Amplitude Control loop, and a 5 GHz CMOS oscillator for Bluetooth
standard.
