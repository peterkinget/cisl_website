Title: Frequency Entrainment: Theory and Applications
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
The understanding of synchronization mechanisms is mandatory in the design of a lot of technical systmes such as PLLs, in the suppresion of phase noise, e.g. in injection locked lasers, in stimulating the heart by an external electrical impulse by a pacemaker and so on.<BR>
The underlying physical effect is referred to as injection locking or frequency entrainment. In recent time injection locking has been applied to the design of quadrature oscillators with low phase-noise and in novel concepts for receiver synchronisation. From a circuit designer's viewpoint the knowledge of the locking range is extremely important.<BR>
In our talk we first review different ways of understanding this phenomenon. Based on that we give a general theory of entrainment based on Floque'ts theory of linear periodic time-varying systems. Based on this theory one obtains a simple differential equation which predicts the locking range reliably. Optimization with regard to system parameters can therefore be done easily. The accuracy of the method could be proven by comparison with a pure numerical method. Based on this, new circuit designs are investigated.

Title: Optimizing Analog CMOS Design from Weak through Strong Inversion
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P> 

Analog CMOS design has been traditionally taught assuming MOS strong 
inversion operation with square-law device characteristics. However, the 
high transconductance efficiency, moderate bandwidth, and low 
drain-source saturation voltage available in moderate inversion make 
this region increasingly important for power efficient, low voltage 
designs. Additionally, there is little or no strong-inversion, 
square-law region for small channel length devices due to velocity 
saturation and other small-geometry, high-field effects. As a result, 
there is a need for analog CMOS design methods that freely permit design 
in weak, moderate, and strong inversion, inclusive of velocity 
saturation, dc mismatch, flicker noise, and other advanced effects. In 
the methods described in this seminar, the inversion coefficient is used 
as a numerical measure of MOS inversion level. Analog CMOS optimization 
is described where drain current, inversion coefficient, and channel 
length are used as the three degrees of design freedom with channel 
width easily determined as needed for layout. Optimized tradeoffs in 
gain, bandwidth, white and flicker noise, dc mismatch, drain-source 
saturation voltage, power efficiency, and other measures are presented. 
Additionally, measured 0.5- and 0.25-um transconductance efficiency, 
gm/ID, and normalized output conductance, VA = ID/gds, is presented from 
weak through strong inversion over a wide range of channel lengths. 
These measurements with comparisons to the EKV 2.6 and 3.0 MOS model 
provide a rich source of information for the modern analog designer. The 
design methods are illustrated on the design of three simple operational 
transconductance amplifiers designed for optimal bandwidth, optimal dc 
gain, dc mismatch, and flicker noise, and balanced bandwidth and dc 
performance. Finally, a CAD tool developed at UNC Charlotte is presented 
to guide the designer towards optimum analog CMOS design without the use 
of time-consuming, iterative circuit simulations.

Is It Time for SPICE 4 ?
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P> 

SPICE originally was released into the public domain in 1971 by the University of California, Berkeley. The program enjoyed almost instant  acceptance, with universities all over the world employing the program in integrated circuit design courses as well as computer-aided design research.  SPICE2 was released into the public domain in 1975, again by the University of California, Berkeley.  SPICE2 also enjoyed wide acceptance, and after SPICE 2G.6, work on SPICE at Berkeley waned.  Not until 1989, almost 15 years later, was SPICE3 released into the public domain by Berkeley.  The latest public-domain SPICE3 simulator was released around 1993, about ten years ago.  This talk will chronicle the crucial role SPICE had in launching a cottage industry of alphabet SPICE programs as well as hundreds of university research projects in various areas of circuit simulation. Paramount in this role was the fact that SPICE has always been in the public domain, available to all at a very nominal cost.  SPICE-like programs, notably SPECTRE and ELDO, have been written since SPICE3 was released, but these follow-on programs are notably not in the public domain. The talk concludes by pondering the question of whether a more recent, public-domain circuit simulation program is necessary at this point.

Design and Simulation of Phased Locked Loops

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract: <P> Phase locked loops (PLL) are  used in a large variety of
applications  ranging from wireless and  wireline  data links to  high
performance  microprocessors.  It is  quickly becoming  clear that the
performance of these circuits will  dictate the achievable performance
of many future systems  since they will set  the spectral mask and A/D
performance  achievable  in future  wireless  systems, and  the jitter
levels    achievable   in  future    data  link    and  microprocessor
applications. Yet, despite  their   importance in current and   future
systems, today's  design techniques are   cumbersome and difficult for
beginners,  and current simulation  techniques are slow and inaccurate
when attempting to characterize both the dynamic and noise performance
of PLL circuits.   In this talk,  we present a computer-aided approach
to PLL  system design that allows  the user to  quickly explore system
level tradeoffs and to quickly assess, at the system level, the impact
of nonidealities such as parasitic poles  and parameter variations due
to changes  in process and   temperature.  We then  present simulation
techniques that  allow fast and accurate  characterization  of PLL and
DLL circuits at a behavioral level, with special focus being placed on
fractional-N frequency synthesizers. Finally, calculated and simulated
phase noise   plots  are compared   to measured  results of  a  custom
fractional-N synthesizer   to  verify the  accuracy   of the presented
techniques.

CMOS Matching In The Digital Era

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P> 
This talk will discuss some issues of (mis-)matching of CMOS transistors and the 
consequences for IC design. Stochastical fluctuations of especially the threshold
voltage of CMOS transistors are considered one of the major bottlenecks in
advanced CMOS design both for analog as well as for digital circuits. Next to a
short introduction to the basic model, several examples of mis-matching
circuits will be shown and design techniques and technological measures will be 
discussed. The trends in more advanced CMOS processes will be discussed 
briefly. The talk will start with a short introduction to Philips Electronics.

A New Chaos Oscillator for Chaos Shift-Keying Communications

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
We present a new structure of chaotic oscillator and demonstrate
its potential applications in chaotic digital communications with both
coherent choas-shift-keying and non-coherent differential chaos-shift-keying.
A new non-coherent communication method which detects binary digits according
to the direction of rotation of the received signal is presented and we
compare its performance with a conventional one based on correlation.

Silicon Integration Choices in Sub-45nm Power Limited Microprocessors

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Traditional scaling of microprocessors relies on performance improvement
of general purpose computations. This is achieved through augmented
architecture and circuit design complexities, apart from device
technology scaling. The performance improvement from architectural and circuit
complexities increase demands higher level of integration and
die size growth. Scaling of device technology results in increased
sub-threshold and tunneling leakage currents. This combination of device
scaling and integration trend results in ever increasing power
consumption which cannot be sustained in the long run. Implementation of
special purpose power efficient applications in future microprocessors
enables us to add functionality without significant power penalty. In
this talk, I will first highlight the above mentioned scaling trends and
the resulting power challenges.  Next, I will present the benefits of
special purpose computation to achieve better power efficiency by
highlighting two communication applications - TCP/IP network processing
and Ultra Wide Band wireless protocol implementation.
