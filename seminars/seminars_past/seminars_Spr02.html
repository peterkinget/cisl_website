<FONT color=#ff0000>Wireless LANs
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
        Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard have achieved wide
customer acceptance in the enterprise environment. They are expected to
continue to expand in popularity and become ubiquitous communication systems
even in private and public places. This paper discusses the basics of the
wireless LAN physical layer, focusing on radio tranceiver specifications and
design options.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Background Calibration Techniques for High Resolution Pipelined
Analog-to-Digital Converters
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Broadband wireless communication systems require high-speed, high-resolution
Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converters designed in digital CMOS process. One
such application in cellular base stations requires the A/D Converter to
digitize multiple channels at IF frequencies as high as 70 MHz with
resolutions greater than 13 bits. Multi-bit Pipelined architecture for
Analog-to-Digital conversion have been shown to provide high throughput at
low power consumption. However practical realizations of these converters in
digital CMOS process suffer from component mismatches, lower amplifier
gains, offsets and charge injection errors, limiting their linearity to 8-10
bits of resolution at sampling rates in only tens of MHz. Existing
Calibration Techniques to improve the resolution of the A/D Converters
suffer from several drawbacks.
<P>
This talk will focus on background calibration techniques to improve the
resolution of Pipelined Analog-to-Digital Converters in digital CMOS
process.  A general idea of the proposed technique is to adaptively correct
for systematic errors in pipelined A/D converter using a least mean squares
approach. The technique will be shown to achieve high linearity with minimal
real estate and power consumption.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Systems and Circuits for Integrated Wireless Receivers</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
The increasing demand for affordable and portable wireless communication
systems has motivated substantial research into the realization of
monolithic transceivers. The use of low-cost CMOS technology is of
particular interest since it provides the possibility of integrating analog
and digital circuitry on the same chip. Furthermore, the trend toward
shifting more complexity from the analog to the digital domain in favor of
robust and flexible performance, suggests more functionality should be
implemented in the digital domain. Of particular interest is channel
selection filtering, an essential function of any receiver. Also, the recent
surge in high-data-rate wireless applications (e.g. wireless local area
networks, multimedia) advocates the use of spectrally-efficient modulation
schemes.
<P>
In this talk, we start with a review of the classical and modern receiver
architectures suitable for a single-chip realization. Also, low-voltage
realizations of RF building blocks (low-noise amplifier and mixer) will be
discussed. Then, two research projects at the University of Toronto on a
low-cost CMOS wireless video communication system are highlighted.  First,
Hierarchical QAM, a new DC-free spectrally-efficient modulation scheme is
presented. Second, the realization of a delta-sigma decimation filter which
also performs as a channel selection and approximate root-Nyquist
pulse-shaping filter is described.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Challenges in Microprocessor Design</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
              Challenges for ultra large-scale silicon products are summarized
under five major headings:  power-delivery, optimization, asychronization,
re-use, and design-skills.  Each is described with a broad brush and with
illustrating examples from the viewpoint of the chip and circuit designer
of microprocessor products.  Synthesis systems are important tools for
meeting these challenges.  Briefly descriped is an advanced synthesis
system for domino with 2Ghz silicon validation results. This is a
workshop-style seminar with no distributed materials or recordings.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Engineering an Efficient SAT Solver</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
      Boolean Satisfiability is probably the most studied of combinatorial
optimization/search problems. Significant effort has been devoted to
trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem
instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design
Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study
has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both
proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find
significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete
solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this
talk I will describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff,
which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering
of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient
implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low
overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two
orders of magnitude performance improvement on difficult SAT benchmarks in
comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.
This is joint work with Matt Moskewicz, Conor Madigan, Ying Zhao and
Lintao Zhang.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Low Power Circuits and Technology for Wireless Digital Systems</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
        As CMOS technology scales to deep submicron lengths, designers face new 
 challenges in determining the proper balance of aggressive high performance 
 devices and lower performance devices to optimize system power and performance 
 for a given application. Determining this balance is crucial for battery 
 powered handheld devices where device leakage and active power limit the 
 available system performance. This talk will explore this question and
describe 
 research in developing low power communication systems which exploit the
 capabilities of advanced CMOS technology.
