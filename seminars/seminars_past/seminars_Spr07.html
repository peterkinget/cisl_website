With the availability of 7 GHz of unlicensed spectrum around 60 GHz,
there is growing interest in using this resource for new consumer
applications requiring very high data rate 2-10 Gb/s in wireless
transmission. Systems communication design on 60 GHz has advantages and
also some disadvantages. The challenges to meet appear not only on RF
design but also on base band side. The different schemes on baseband
architecture will be discussed considering their degree of complexity.
<br> <br>Mahbod Eyvazkhani has obtained his engineering
diploma(M.Sc.), DEA and a PhD from Ecole Nationale superieure des
Telecommunications (ENST-paris) in France. He was employed at Bell-Labs
(Lucent Technologies), Globespan and two other start-up befor joining
Nokia. He is currently working on mmWave wireless communication project
(60GHz) as a principal scientist at Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto.
His main interests include equalization, channel coding and modulation
on communication systems with emphasis on analog and VLSI
implementation.

                  <div style="text-align: justify;">
We present a flash ADC design technique that compensates for
static nonlinearity of the up-front sample and hold
circuit, so that high speed and high linearity can be obtained at the
same time. This enables the use of a significantly larger input
signal swing than would otherwise be possible, translating eventually
into reduced power dissipation. The proposed technique functions in
synergy with a new background comparator offset &nbsp;correction
scheme. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques with measurement
results &nbsp;from &nbsp;a 160 Msps 6-bit flash converter designed in a
0.35-$\mu\rm{m}$ &nbsp;CMOS process. The ADC consumes 50~mW from a
3.3~V power supply and has an ENOB of &nbsp;5.3 bits at Nyquist.

An active POTS filter consisting of a small external L-C low-pass filter and a selectivity booster chip is presented.
The filter achieves an ADSL attenuation of more than 70dB at 30kHz while maintaining a passband flatness of 0.2dB.
<br> <br>This active filter requires fewer transformers and is smaller
than a passive filter with the same performance. The 0.5um CMOS booster
chip contains a 5th-order continuous-time filter, a low
output-impedance driver, and an active rectifier and consumes 50mW from
a 5V AC supply.

                  Formal spectral theory for feedback systems with quantization (Sigma-Delta modulation)

                  <br>
                  </span>
                  <div style="text-align: justify;">
A Sigma-Delta modulator is an analog-to-digital converter that includes
a scalar quantizer in a feedback loop. This permits the achievement of
high-resolution conversions with a coarse and imprecise quantization.
The error analysis of this system however escapes from the existing
signal and system theories. In the signal processing/communications
area, only linear feedback systems are rigorously understood. <br> <br>
We build rigorous foundations to the error analysis of Sigma-Delta
modulators by importing knowledge from dynamical systems into the
classic linear system framework. We drop the standard signal processing
approach, which looks at the quantizer error signal as the
transformation of the input signal by some transfer function. Instead,
we present this error signal as the output of an input-free and
time-invariant dynamical system. This is possible in steady state when
the input is a finite sum of sinusoids.
<br> <br>This new signal approach allows the use of "noble"
mathematical tools such as functional analysis, for the rigorous
analysis of quantization. This is a major contribution, as the discrete
nature of quantization has prevented the use of continuous mathematics
and has typically required the use of approximate and stochastic models
(noise). Under the new framework, we derive rigorously quantization
error spectra thanks to the powerful properties of unitary operators in
Hilbert Spaces. The famous former work by Robert Gray and related
authors performed in the special case of "ideal" modulators finds
itself concisely rewritten as one particular case of this new theory.

The biotechnology industry has greatly matured in the in the past decade, a credit to
recent scientific discoveries enabled by the new detection platforms.
However, the performance of current detection platforms in
biotechnology is still far from the ideal and thus there is a huge room
for improvement. Their specificity (SNR), throughput, and dynamic range
are even unacceptable for demanding applications such as point-of-care
molecular diagnostics. Today, many of the researchers in electrical
engineering and its related fields find this as a unique opportunity.
Accordingly, we see a significant growth in the number of collaborative
research projects between electrical engineers and biotechnologists to
address the fundamental challenges of high-performance biological
detection, i.e., biosensors.
<br> <br>
The recent efforts in engineering, broadly defined, to address
challenges of biotechnology have been mostly technology-driven.
Unfortunately, it is very common to find many biotechnology-related
engineering projects which attempt to &#8220;force&#8221; an existing engineering
solution onto a biological application. Our goal in this talk is to
look at the problem of detection (and biosensing) by using an
application-driven approach, and examine the imperative and
performance-limiting aspects of existing biosensor platforms. Our main
focus will be on the affinity-based biosensor array technology (i.e.,
microarray platform) which is among the most powerful and widely used
detection technologies in Genomics and Proteomics.
<br> <br>
Initially in this talk we will examine the underlying physics of
bio-molecular interactions which result in measurement uncertainty in
affinity-based biosensors. Subsequently, we will introduce the concept
of biological shot-noise and formulate the quantum-limited SNR of
biosensors and microarrays, followed by the affects of non-specific
binding (interference) and probe saturation (nonlinearity) on the
limits of detection. The rest of this talk involves the methods which
we have developed to increase the performance of microarrays. On the
biochemical side, we demonstrate how real-time detection significantly
increases the minimum-detection-level (MDL), while making probe
saturation irrelevant. One the sensor implementation side, we
demonstrate how standard CMOS processes can be used to integrate the
microarray platform into a true system-on-a-chip (SoC) real-time
integrated microarray system

                  <div style="text-align: justify;">Low-power data
conversion has evolved as a key requirement in many modern electronic
devices. Our work targets the development of a new class of ultra-low
power "digitally assisted" ADCs. These converters are based on
minimalistic, but power efficient analog sub-circuits and use digital
processing for performance recovery and/or enhancement. Preliminary
results presented in the first part of this talk indicate that this
approach may deliver order-of-magnitude improvements in power
efficiency. The second part of this presentation outlines our research
activities in circuit design for MEMS and sensor interfaces. Specific
highlights include a digitally assisted, low-drift MEMS accelerometer
and MEMS-based resonators.<br>

Integrated Biosensors</span> <br>
                  <br>
                  <div style="text-align: justify;"> Over the past few
years, we have witnessed a significant increase in research on
biological systems by engineers for environmental and biomedical
diagnostics. The research span a wide field ranging from biologically
inspired systems (such as silicon retinas and cochleae), through
electronic instrumentation of biological phenomena (such as DNA
microarrays and chemical sensors) to man-machine interfaces (such as
deep brain array stimulators and neuroprosthetic devices). Despite
efforts to develop chips for biological assay detection, there
continues to be a need to improve implementations of micro-scale
detection and processing systems for further convenience, scaling and
portability. These devices will lead to a significant cost-savings,
throughput increases, and enable heretofore infeasible biological
assays making &#8220;in the field&#8221; biological testing a reality. Thus
infectious diseases can be detected rapidly and accurately onsite
potentially averting the spread of illnesses or tainted foodstuffs. <br>
                  <br>
We will present the design and implementation of monolithic and hybrid
sensors using integrated circuits, particularly in CMOS. We will begin
by providing the definitions and performance metrics of sensors.
Subsequently, we will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of
sensors built in silicon-based fabrication processes and examine, in
detail, their integrated circuit topologies. Next, we will provide a
comprehensive study of the design and analysis of CMOS integrated image
sensors, integrated biosensors, and electronic backbone of MEMS hybrid
sensors including silicon photodetectors; CCD and CMOS sensor
architectures and circuits; affinity-based detection and biochemical
transduction, integrated microarrays, biochips, and sensor SoCs.<br>

Reconfigurable Wireless Terminals &#8211; a First Step Towards Software
Defined Radio</span> <br>
                  <br>
                  <div style="text-align: justify;"> Multimedia
applications are driving wireless operators to add
high-speed data services such as E-GPRS, UMTS and WLAN (IEEE
802.11a,b,g) to the existing GSM network. This creates the need for
multi-mode handsets that support a wide range of standards with
different RF frequencies, signal bandwidth, modulation schemes, etc.
This generates design challenges for the building blocks of the
physical layer. In addition to the above protocols, mobile devices
often include Bluetooth, GPS, FM-radio and TV services that can work
concurrently with data and voice. Sharing and/or switching transceiver
building blocks in these handsets is used to extend battery life and/or
reduce cost. More specifically adaptive circuits that can reconfigure
themselves within the handover time are used to enable a single
receiver/transmitter covering all the different standards while
ensuring seamless interoperability. This paper presents RF and analog
base-band circuits that are able to support GSM (with Edge), WCDMA
(UMTS), WLAN and Bluetooth using reconfigurable building blocks. The
blocks can trade off power consumption for performance on the fly,
depending on the standard to be supported and the required Quality of
Service. Experimental measurements in a 0.13 um CMOS technology are
presented and discussed. </div>
