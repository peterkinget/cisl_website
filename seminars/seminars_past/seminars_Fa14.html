[SSCS Distinguished Lecture Tour-1] On-Chip Voltage and Timing Diagnostic Circuits					
</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>
This talk introduces a set of practical and powerful techniques and circuits to observe and characterize on-die circuitry. Measuring voltage and timing information on the chip itself alleviates the bandwidth and noise limitations associated with bringing signals off-chip to be measured. Specific applications of these techniques include measurement and characterization of power supply noise, power delivery impedance, clock skew, phase interpolator linearity, I/O eye margins, waveform capture, RX voltage noise and hysteresis, and RX clock-data jitter. Because the measurements are fully integrated, the rest of the system can be automatically adapted based on these metrics in a stand-alone manner. Best of all, many of these techniques leverage existing circuitry and are highly digital.

[SSCS Distinguished Lecture Tour-2] Terahertz and Millimeter-Wave Frequency Generation and Synthesis in Silicon					
</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>
THz  and  millimeter-wave  (mm-wave)  imaging  and  sensing  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the emerging and disruptive technologies over the next decade. THz (including the W-band) waves pass through non-conducting materials such as clothes, paper, wood and brick and so cameras sensitive  to  them  can  peer  inside  envelopes,  into  living  rooms  and  "frisk"  people  at  distance. THz/mm-wave  imaging  and  sensing  systems,  therefore,  will  be  key  enabling  components  in applications  such  as  security  surveillance  (to  find  concealed  weapons  and  explosives),  nondestructive  testing,  biology,  radio  astronomy,  multi-gigabit  wireless connectivity,  and  medical imaging.  One  of  the  most  critical  and  daunting  tasks  in  a THz/mm-wave  system  is  signal generation  and  frequency  synthesis.  This  invited  talk presents  an  overview  and  comparative study of recent research efforts which have explored several circuit techniques and architectures leading to highly efficient frequency synthesis, signal generation, and mm-wave LO distribution networks in silicon.

[SSCS Distinguished Lecture Tour-3] Low-Power, High-Bandwidth, and Ultra-Small Memory Module Design			
</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>
This work proposes a novel DRAM module and interconnect architectures in an attempt to improve computing energy use and performance. A low cost advanced packaging technology is used to propose an 8 die and 32-die memory module. The 32-die memory module measures less than 2 cm3. The size and packaging technique allow the memory module to consume less power than conventional module designs. A 4 Gb DRAM architecture utilizing 64 data pins is proposed. The DRAM architecture is inline with ITRS roadmaps and can consume 50% less power while increasing bandwidth by 100%. The largenumber of data pins are supported by a low power capacitive-coupled interconnect. The receivers developed for the capacitive interface were fabricated in 0.5 µm and 65 nm CMOS technologies. The 0.5 µm design operated at 200 Mbps, used a coupling capacitor of 100 fF, and consumed less than 3 pJ/bit of energy. The 65 nm design operated at 4 Gbps, used a coupling capacitor of 15 fF, and consumed less than 15 fJ/bit and order of magnitude smaller consumptions than previously reported receiver designs.

Rethinking Analog-Digital Interface Circuit Architectures			
</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>
The trend of modern electronic systems in both wireless and wireline applications demands increasing bandwidth, dynamic range, and reconfigurability but low power and cost. On the other hand, the technology scaling is slowing down its pace and incurs significant cost particularly for analog designs. Those factors have driven the mixed-signal design community to pursue new circuit architectures towards unprecedented performance, power efficiency and flexibility. In this talk, we will examine several such attempts in ADC, DAC, and PLL designs recently demonstrated by our group members. The initial silicon prototypes in 65nm CMOS achieve encouraging power efficiency and performance in comparison with the state of the arts, which tout the potential for many future extensions.

[SSCS Distinguished Lecture] The Return of Neuro-Inspired Computing - Why Now?					
</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Barring technologies surprises (such as the discovery of a perfect nanometer switch), alternative design strategies may be necessary if continued scaling of functionality in terms of size and energy is to be obtained. Neuro-inspired computing is one possible direction to be considered. Over the past decade, the brain has been receiving a lot of attention (e.g. the BRAIN initiatives in the US and Europe)-mostly from a mapping and an understanding perspective. The brain is an amazingly complex and efficient machine. While it may not be considered "general purpose" in terms of its computational capabilities, it performs a set of functions such as feature extraction, classification, synthesis, recognition, learning, and higher-order decision-making amazingly well. Carver Mead already realized this in the late 1980's- yet the technological landscape at that time was not amenable to make neuromorphic computing an attractive alternative.
<br>
Today, it is realized that neuro-inspired computing may be a perfect match to the properties of the emerging nano-scale devices (such as 3D integration, carbon and spin devices, non-volatile memory cells such as RRAM, etc): it thrives on randomness and variability, processing is performed in the continuous or discrete domains, and massive parallelism, major redundancy and adaptivity are of essence. Computational paradigms inspired by neural information processing hence may lead to energy-efficient, low-cost, dense and/or reliable implementations of the functions the brain excels at. In this presentation, we will explore various means on how the interaction between neuroscience and information technology may lead to an exciting future.

<br><br>
