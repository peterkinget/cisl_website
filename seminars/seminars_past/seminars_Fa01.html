<FONT color=#ff0000>Power-Aware Architectures</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
       Since power consumption is now a first-class design contraint,
"power-awareness" is a necessary aspect of modeling and design. This is
true for all stages of design and at all levels of abstraction. In this
talk, we will focus on power-aware design at the  microarchitecture
definition stage. We start by presenting our group's work on early-stage,
workload-driven power-performance modeling. Augmenting the current
architectural simulation tools to include energy behavior of the
unit-level components is the first step in conducting research in this
emerging new area. We also describe the model validation methods that we
are pursuing to understand the relative and absolute accuracy implications
of such early-stage models. In the second part of the talk, we describe
some of the specific power-aware microarchitecture ideas that we have
studied. We present simulation-based and analytical results to understand:
(a) the power-performance efficiency benefits of dynamic adaptation and
throttling of on-chip computing resources: e.g. issue queues and
instruction fetch bandwidth; (b) the fundamental limits of scaling within
a given microarchitectural paradigm: e.g. super scalar, with and without
simultaneous multithreading (SMT) as well as chip multiprocessing. We also
address the microarchitectural support issues for coarse- and fine-grain
clock gating as well as Vdd (power) gating; and, we project the effect of
such "gating" methods on power-performance scalability.

<P>
Abstract:
<P>                Designing CMOS devices for high-performance servers has always
been a challenge. Scaling devices to keep up with the higher performance
Moore's Law demands from each generation has already forced gate lengths
below 0.1um and gate oxides below 1.5nm, so ever more creative methods of
technology improvement -- beyond simple scaling -- are needed.  To face
this challenge, IBM has been a leader in introducing many new materials,
such as Cu wires and SiLK(TM) low-K intermetal dielectric, and new
technologies, such as SOI and strained-Si.  This talk will cover many of
these technologies, and how they affect the device designers task,
particularly focusing on SOI CMOS design.  In addition, the rise of the
internet, high-speed networking, and mobile computing have introduced a
new set of requirements for semiconductor technologies.  Various
extensions of SOI CMOS that attempt to meet these needs, such as adding
devices optimized for RF or low-power performance, as well as embedding
DRAM into SOI logic processes, will also be touched on briefly.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Recent Advances in SOI Circuit Design</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>        This presentation reviews recent advances in SOI circuit design
for high-performance digital applications with particular emphasis on the
circuit / design issues resulting from the unique SOI device structure.
The technology / device choices / requirements and design challenges are
highlighted.  Unique design aspects for partially-depleted SOI , such as
parasitic bipolar effect, hysteretic Vt variation, temperature dependence,
and scaling implications, are addressed.   Circuit techniques to improve
the noise immunity and performance, and design methodology to handle and
contain the hysteretic Vt variation are discussed.
