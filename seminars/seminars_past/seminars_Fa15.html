The field of neuromorphic VLSI aims to replicate the amazing functionality of biological systems using conventional electronic circuits. Characteristics of biological systems are imitated with the goal of both understanding biology and replicating its efficiency for cognitive tasks. This talk provides an abbreviated history of the field, and presents some of the joint work we have been doing with IBM research on an all-digital approach to neuromorphic system engineering that culminated in TrueNorth--a low-power single chip million neuron system.

Fracking for 5G: Reconfigurable RF and High-Efficiency Millimeter-wave Circuit Techniques for Better Spectrum Usage

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Mobile data demands are rapidly growing beyond the capabilities of licensed RF bands. To reach gigabit-per-second speeds, the cellular industry is considering a significant jump from RF to millimeter-wave bands over the next decade to alleviate congestion at RF bands. To take the most advantage of the current RF spectrum, software-defined radios are needed to hop to available spectrum.  This talk will present our investigations into enabling CMOS circuits based on reconfigurable N-path filters for interference mitigation. At mm-wave bands, our ongoing work has demonstrated record output power from CMOS SOI millimeter-wave PAs and this talk will discuss system demands on transmit schemes, specifically outphasing, for high power and peak efficiency.

Low Power Passive Switched Capacitor Analog Signal Processing Circuit and Systems
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
This talk will discuss several passive analog switched capacitor signal processing techniques. These types of signal processing would traditionally be done in the digital domain but in the analog domain the power requirements can be significantly reduced.
<br>
The switched capacitor techniques described here have been developed over the last few years and were part of the Lyric Semiconductor acquisition (now the Analog Garage) by ADI. These techniques have also been characterized in a released product. 
<br>
The application of this Sampled Analog Technology (SAT) as passive embedded signal processing blocks enables lower power designs with increased signal processing capability.
<br>
In addition, the ADC requirements are also reduced, allowing a further reduction to the power consumption. 
<br>
Several examples with measured and modelled results will be discussed.

<br><br><b>
Biography:
</b><br>
Eric Nestler is an ADI Division Fellow working in the Analog Garage, Cambridge, MA.
He received his BSEE from Tufts University and a MSEE from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
After working at HP Medical and Symbolics, Inc he joined ADI in 1987.
<br>
Eric is the founder of the Energy Metering division in ADI that has shipped 
over 500 Million energy metering parts during that last 20 years.
Eric left ADI in 2004 to work for two startups. The second, Lyric Semiconductor, 
was acquired by ADI in June 2011.
<br>
While at Lyric Eric developed switched-capacitor analog signal processing 
circuit technology that provides very low power for complex signal processing. 
His present work is in Ultra Low Power Sampled Analog Technology (SAT) designs 
applied to areas such as sensor interfaces, and ultrasound imaging.
Eric has over 25 patents issued in a number circuit and product areas.

Abstract:
</b><br>
The evolving broadband wireless communication increasingly drives fast development on high-performance consumer portable smart and green gadgets with longer battery life, which leads to growing demands on high-speed ADCs with higher energy efficiency. 
SAR-type ADCs which take advantages of CMOS technology downscaling for their "highly digital" implementation have been dominating large segments of high-speed and energy efficient ADCs with efficiencies down to fJ/conversion step at 100MHz+ sampling rate. 
This talk provides firstly an overview of the state-of-the-art SAR-Type high energy-efficient ADCs, and then present the trends of the ADCs through the energy, speed and noise Analysis for various architectures including SAR & Binary-Search, Multi-bit SAR, Flash SAR and Pipeline SAR, Time-interleaved and etc. 
<br>
Practical design examples and the state-of-the-art techniques will be also analyzed.

Design Automation of Things, the Future of EDA
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
This talk introduces a new area of Design Automation, Design Automation of Things, that attempts to apply Electronics Design Automation design, optimization and synthesis methods to other applications (Things.) In this talk, we introduce the first step toward systematic electric vehicle (EV) design-time and runtime optimization. We develop instantaneous power consumption modeling of an EV by the curb weights, speed, acceleration, road slope, passenger and cargo weights, motor capacity, and so on, as a battery discharge model. To insure model fidelity, we fabricate a lightweight custom EV, perform extensive measurement, and derive model coefficients using multivariable regression analysis. We estimate the EV instantaneous power consumption of a given speed and route profiles and verify the estimation fidelity with a real test run data. This talk will introduce several research challenges and opportunities based on the EV model for accurate range estimation and minimum-energy EV design/operation.

Trustworthy Hardware
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Hardware security and trust is an important design objective similar to power, performance, reliability and testability. I will highlight why hardware security and trust are important objectives from the economics, security, and safety perspectives. Important learning outcomes of this talk include (i) understanding simple gotchas when traditional DFT, test, and validation techniques are used (scan chains, JTAG, SoC test, assertion based validation), (ii) understand how traditional DFT, test and validation techniques can be used to improve hardware security and trust and finally (iii) understand "Design for Trust" approaches that can provide testability without compromising security and trust.

Advanced conditioning circuits for capacitive transducers in vibration energy harvesters
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Miniature energy harvesting devices are believed to be a key for the autonomy of smart sensors. Kinetic energy, e.g., vibrations, is present in many environments, and generation of electricity out of mechanical vibrations is an active research area in many groups. One of the promising technique for electromechanical conversion is offered by capacitive transducers, where the electricity is generated when a charged variable capacitor decreases its capacitance because of motion of one of its electrodes. This harvesting technique is well-suitable for miniaturisation, since the sensors are often implemented in MEMS silicon technologies. 
<br>
In order to maximise the generation of electricity, the variable capacitor needs a dynamic electrical bias. This is achieved by the conditioning electronics, which controls the energy conversion process by defining the charge-voltage cycle on the variable capacitance. Since the power converted by electrostatic devices is not above few tens of microwatts, very stringent requirements are applied to the conditioning electronics.
<br>
The seminar presents the results of recent studies on family of conditioning circuits for electrostatic transducers which implement rectangular QV cycle. These circuits are based on the charge pump architecture, and have a common property of self-synchronisation with the external vibrations, so simplifying the design of the control electronics. Some of these circuits offers a very precious feature: accumulation of the converted energy inside of the conditioning circuit. This allows an easy control of the biasing of the transducer, and opens a possibility for adaptive operation of the energy harvesting system. Some specific issues such as electromechanical coupling and interface with the load will also be discussed.
