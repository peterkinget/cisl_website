Using Moore's Law to Break Eroom's Law? --- Multimodal CMOS Cellular Interface for High Throughput Drug Screening and New Drug Development.

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Cells are highly complex systems that often exhibit multi-physics responses under external stimulus. To achieve holistic cellular characterizations, it is essential to create interfaces that can provide (1) single-cell resolution, (2) multi-modality interfacing with cells, (3) real-time two-way communication (sensing and actuation), (4) compatibility with high throughput massively parallel operations, and (5) possibility of production at commercial quantities. The nanometer-scale complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process is a potential candidate to realize cell-microelectronics interfaces. Electronics-based computations and signal processing, such as machine learning methods, may drastically relax the requirement on the physical interface and lead to further pixel miniaturization.
<br>In this talk, we will present several fully integrated multi-modality CMOS cellular joint sensor/actuator arrays with multiple sensing modalities in every array pixel to characterize different cell physiological responses, including extracellular voltage recording, cellular impedance mapping, and optical detection with shadow imaging and bioluminescence sensing. Each pixel also contains electrical voltage/current excitation for cellular stimulation. These reported CMOS cellular joint sensor/actuator arrays comprise up-to 22k multi-modality pixels on each chip with spatial resolution down to 17um*17um/pixel, achieving single-cell resolution. Multi-modality cellular sensing at the pixel level is supported, which enables holistic cell characterization and concurrent joint-modality physiological monitoring on the same cellular sample. Comprehensive biological experiments with different living cell samples demonstrate the functionality.

Living on the Edge of the IoT: Sensing and Communicating in Energy Starved Environments

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Wireless communications and miniature sensing technologies
have developed significantly over the past decade with the advent of the smart phone. However, the communications and sensing technologies developed around the cellular handset market are largely incompatible in energy consumption, frequency band, and data rate with agricultural, environmental, infrastructure, and industrial sensing, referred to here as the edge of the internet-of-things (IoT). While communications for consumer wireless sensors have primarily developed in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, the radio frequency (RF) propagation losses at this frequency are extremely high both on the ground and through structural materials and foliage. In contrast to cellular phones that can recharge relatively large batteries daily, edge IoT sensors must operate for many years without plugging in to recharge the battery or, in some cases, without a battery at all. The low carrier frequencies and energy expense of RF transmissions necessitates sensing and processing technologies for detecting, classifying and compressing the large amount of sensor data into useful information, while the amount of energy available is orders of magnitude lower than a smart phone. 

<br>This seminar will present microtechnologies for communications and sensing that are compatible with the stringent energy consumption, data rates and operating frequencies needed at the edge of the IoT. Microelectromechanical resonators for providing high performance, miniature, and low cost RF components in the 150 MHz to 400 MHz bands needed for ground emplaced and structural sensors will be discussed. A new class of intelligent nanowatt wakeup sensors and radio receivers will also be presented. These wakeup components can detect and classify sensor and RF signatures while consuming lower power than the leakage rate of a small battery, greatly extending the lifetime of energy constrained wireless sensor nodes. Finally, technology gaps and new research areas needed to fully deploy long-life sensors at the edge of the IoT will be identified.

SSCS Distinguished Lecture: RF Harmonic Oscillators Integrated in Silicon Technologies


</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

As one of the truly fundamental analog functions in any wireless/wireline application, the voltage-controlled oscillator keeps attracting a great deal of well-deserved attention. In this presentation, we will investigate the mechanisms of phase noise generation in harmonic oscillators, including some recently published general results, after which we will analyze both classical and emergent oscillator architectures, describing pros and cons for each. Various techniques to achieve a very wide oscillator tuning range will be illustrated as well.

Taming Waves in High Frequency IC Design


</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Waves are everywhere: the strings of musical instruments, a curious cloud pattern, the distribution of cars on a highway, and radio waves among mobile devices. In this talk, we focus on electromagnetic waves in high-frequency ICs, and discuss how they can be properly controlled to perform useful functions by engineering linear and nonlinear propagation media. Based on this approach, I will present four IC examples implemented in a CMOS process for 1) a new type of tunable delay line, 2) efficient clock distribution, 3) passive frequency division, and 4) <10-ps pulse generation.

Power Supply Noise in Server Chips: improving Power/Performance   
on IBM's Latest 14nm Processors 

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Enterprise server chip design poses a hard power-supply noise problem. Increasing transistor counts and supply voltage scaling can create instantaneous changes in current, driving nanosecond-speed supply voltage (VDD) droops that require extra guard-band for correct product operation. The POWER9TM�and z14TM�processor use advanced mitigation techniques such as adaptive clocking and instruction throttling to ensure that processor functionality is maintained during power- supply droops. We will present the POWER9TM� adaptive clocking strategy, embedding analog voltage-droop monitors (VDMs) that direct a digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) to immediately reduce clock frequency in response to a droop, and the z14TM advanced noise mitigation throttling options using the critical path monitor (CPM).

Monolithic Optical Phased Arrays

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Advancements in semiconductor manufacturing, computer-aided design tools, and integrated circuit architectures have enabled monolithic realization of 1 � 100 GHz radiofrequency phased arrays in commercial foundry processes for automotive radars, commercial wireless communications (e.g., 5G), and other applications.
Optical phased arrays enable imaging, sensing, display, holography, free space optical communications, and many other applications. For instance, a phased array lidar reduces the size, weight, and power consumption of traditional mechanically-scanning lidars while it enhances the reliability, flexibility, and functionality. Challenges associated with monolithic realization of optical phased arrays include compact realization of optical phased array components; sensitivity of the phased array to fabrication tolerances and process variations given the short wavelength of optical frequencies; inadequate models, CAD tools, and systematic design methodologies.
In this talk, it is shown that a holistic approach that takes inspirations from complex radio-frequency integrated circuits can enable realization of complex optical integrated circuits with unprecedented functionalities. The talk will cover the basics, applications, and past realizations of optical phased arrays followed by our demonstrations of large-scale monolithic optical phased arrays in a commercial foundry CMOS SOI technology. The talk will also cover design of silicon photonic components that benefit large-scale realization of optical phased arrays. Ongoing challenges and research directions will also be discussed.

Computing with Dynamical Systems


</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>

Collective dynamical systems offer unique opportunities for computing by harnessing the complex interactions of simple elements such as oscillators or spike generators. This is possible, when such dynamics can be programmed, controlled, and observed. In this talk, I will present some of our work where we are exploring the time-evolution of both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems in both CMOS and post-CMOS computing substrates. I will show applications of such systems in solving inverse problems, distributed optimizations (convex and combinatorial) and machine learning. In particular, I will discuss our recent work that connects dynamics and algebraic graph theory. Finally I will talk about implementation of such dynamics in mixed-signal CMOS, including a recent demonstration of reinforcement learning for energy-constrained edge devices. I will conclude with a brief discussion of the opportunities, potentials and challenges in realizing such computational systems.
