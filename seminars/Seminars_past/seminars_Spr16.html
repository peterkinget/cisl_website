Mostly Digital Phase-Locked Loops

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
This talk will discuss the fundamentals of digital phase-locked loops and analyze the mechanisms of generation of limit cycles, which manifest themselves as spurious tones at the output. Then, we will compare two different quantization strategies and develop practical design examples showing how to set loop parameters and optimize phase noise and jitter. The second part of the tutorial will be devoted to fractional-N synthesis, in which quantization and nonlinearity add new sources of spurious tones: We will review the different design techniques which help mitigate such impairments.

Memoryless Analog-to-Digital Conversion Using Delta-Sigma Modulators Without Reset

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Delta-Sigma architectures are usually the best choice for high resolution analog-to-digital converters. But when the input is multiplexed from a number of inputs, delta-sigma ADCs cannot be used directly. The memory in the modulator and the decimation filter results in inter-sample interference. To eliminate this, the conversion cycle has to be made long enough for the impulse response of the modulator and decimator to die out before applying the next sample. This results in a substantially lower sampling rate than when the Delta-Sigma ADC is used continuously. Alternatively, the modulator and decimation filter can be reset to realize an incremental delta-sigma modulator. In this case, there is an SNR penalty since the filtering less effective. In this work, it is shown that memoryless analog-to-digital conversion using $\Delta\Sigma$ modulators is possible without resetting the modulator or decimation filters. This is done by constraining the combined signal transfer function for the modulator and a decimation filter to satisfy Nyquist intersymbol interference criterion. This architecture enables memoryless operation over the entire signal bandwidth of the Delta-Sigma modulator which is significantly higher than the bandwidth in incremental architectures in which the modulator is reset. A two-channel ADC with sampling rate of fs/64 per channel is built using a third order 32 times oversampled switched-capacitor  modulator. The prototype in 0.18um CMOS occupies 2.1mmsq. At 64MHz sampling rate for the DSM, the standalone modulator consumes 25mW and has a DR/SNRmax/SNDRmax of 85/82/80.3 dB. The sample-and-hold required for multi-channel operation consumes 20 mW. In two-channel mode, with 1 MHz sampling rate per channel, the DR/SNRmax/SNDRmax of 80/76/75 dB. The crosstalk between channels is less than 85 dB. The total power consumption for two channels is 45 mW.

2-hr Short Course: Clock and Data Recovery Techniques for Optical Communication Systems
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) is a key function in a communication system. We begin this part of the course with a review of the fundamentals of CDR in Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) serial links. System level metrics like jitter-tolerance, jitter-transfer and jitter-generation are introduced to evaluate the performance of a CDR. Several CDR architectures are discussed. Their advantages and drawbacks specifically for high-speed optical systems are compared. Many optical systems require a reference-less CDR. Various techniques to extract frequency from the incoming data are explained in detail. Linear and bang-bang phase detectors at full-rate are introduced. Sub-rate structures that ease the speed requirements of the circuits are also described.

Holistic Energy-Efficient Design in Optical Interconnects
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The scalability of CMOS technology has driven computation into a diverse range of applications across the power consumption, performance and size spectra. Communication is a necessary adjunct to computation, and whether in the context of high-performance computing, mobile devices or biomedical implants, chip-to-chip communication can take up a significant portion of the overall system power budget. Today Data Center and High Performance Computing (HPC) performance is increasingly limited by interconnection bandwidth. Maintaining continued aggregate bandwidth growth without overwhelming the power budget for these large scale computing systems and data centers is paramount. The historic power efficiency gains via CMOS technology scaling for such interconnects have rolled off over the past decade, and new low-cost approaches are necessary. In this talk a number of promising solutions including Silicon-Photonic-based interconnects that can overcome these challenges will be discussed.  In particular effective co-design of electronics and photonics as a holistic approach for reducing the total power consumption and enhancing the performance of the link will be presented.

The Challenges of Implementing Broadband ADCs
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The exploding demand for high speed wired and wireless data networks has radically changed today's data RF transceivers and modems. Gigahertz bandwidths require broadband ADC architectures. Although initial ideas for this architecture was filed as a patent in 2003, it took another 9 years before it would become a reality. This seminar talks about some of the challenges of implementing broadband ADCs. The talk also describes several applications of this technology and how it has transformed the data communications industry.

Energy efficient circuit technologies for the sub-14nm era: challenges and opportunities

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
This lecture presents some of the prominent barriers to designing energy-efficient circuits in the sub-14nm CMOS technology regime and outlines new paradigm shifts necessary in next-generation multi-core microprocessors and systems-on-chip. Emerging trends and key challenges in sub-14nm design are outlined, including (i) device and on-chip interconnect technology projections, (ii) performance, leakage and voltage scalability, (iii) special-purpose hardware accelerators and reconfigurable co-processors for compute-intensive signal processing algorithms, (iv) fine-grain power management with integrated voltage regulators, and (v) resilient circuit design to enable robust variation-tolerant operation. Energy-efficient arithmetic and logic circuit techniques, static/dynamic supply scaling, on-die interconnect fabric circuits, ultra-low-voltage and near-threshold logic and memory circuit techniques, and multi-supply/multi-clock domain design for switching and leakage energy reduction are described. Special purpose hardware accelerators and data-path building blocks for enabling high GOPS/Watt on specialized DSP tasks such as encryption, graphics and media processing are presented. Power efficient optimization of microprocessors to span a wide operating range across high performance servers to ultra mobile SoCs, dynamic on-the fly configurability and adaptation, and circuit techniques for active/standby-mode leakage reduction with robust low-voltage operability are reviewed. Specific chip design examples and case studies supported by silicon measurements and trade-offs will be discussed.<br><br><b>
