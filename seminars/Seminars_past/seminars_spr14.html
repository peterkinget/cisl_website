Compact Thermal Sensors in Intel Processors from 90nm to 22nm
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Temperature sensing and regulation in microprocessors are important for power management and have a direct influence on power/performance.  When the chip gets too hot, its frequency gets lowered in a process called throttling, in order to prevent it from exceeding the maximum reliable operating point.  As temperature is lowered, the frequency of the chip can degrade because of the ITD effect (Inverse Temperature Dependence).  In this case, information from the thermal sensor is used to raise the supply voltage to maintain performance.  The thermal sensor is also used for fan regulation and prevents the chip from burning itself up in thermal runaway.  In the older chips, there was a single core, so it was sufficient to have one or two thermal sensors per IC, and the power and area were not very important.  Since the industry shifted to multicore, there can be as many as 25 sensors per chip, so their area and power have become substantial.  In addition, analog circuits tend to have very poor scaling between process generations, or even reverse scale.  In the Nehalem generation the thermal sensors occupied more than 1% of the overall die area, and consumed > 200mW, so there was much motivation to scale them down.
In our group in Yakum, Israel, we have developed compact and power-efficient thermal sensors.  Using novel analog architectures and circuit techniques the area and power were scaled by > 10X in the same process generation.  The level of scaling in analog is virtually unheard of.  In the Sandy-Bridge processor, we implemented an NMOS based sensor, which measured the temperature dependence of threshold voltage (Vt) and mobility (Mu) and output a temperature-dependent frequency.
In addition, we also developed a very compact diode-based thermal sensor which used a band-gap reference to generate a temperature-dependent voltage, which was measured using a frequency-based analog-to-digital converter.  The diode sensor is considered more reliable than the NMOS based design since Vt and Mu change during the process evolution.  The 22nm sensor was one of the world's first analog circuits reported at this process node.  
These sensors have been benchmarked as the smallest IC thermal sensors in the art, with sizes < 0.006 mm2.  They also have a very fast sampling speed (> 5kS/sec), which enable them to capture fast thermal transients on the processor.  The designs are very robust and can be manufactured with > 99.9% yield.
The evolution of these sensors from 90nm down to 22nm will be discussed, along with some of challenges inherent in designing analog circuits in the noisy, pure-digital environment of a microprocessor.

A simple method to calculate the power spectrum of distorted wide-band signals
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The correct analysis of distortion products is one of the most important aspects in the design of low-power low-cost communication devices. There is a fundamental trade off between cost, power and dynamic range of the system. More precisely, the lower and upper boundaries of the dynamic range are determined respectively by the linearity and noise performance of the system, which in turn are determined by the technology choice, architecture and power consumption of the system itself.  As an application example, a typical RF signal receiver is composed by a cascade of blocks performing operation of filtering, amplifying, frequency translation and data conversion.  An almost century-long of literature on this topic has shown that for a given performance specification, the optimal design in terms of power consumption and cost is determined by a correct distribution of gain, filtering, and noise and distortion performance among the various blocks constituting the receiving chain.  Another very important application is the determination of spurious spectral emission of a transmission system.  Spectrum scarcity and pollution due to older standard (like the TV system) has forced government controlled agencies (FCC, ETSI, …) to define transmission regulations, including strict spectrum emission masks.  This fact ultimately results on the architectural choice of the power amplifier of the transmitter, and the consequent trade-off between its linearity and power efficiency.  As of today, the determination of the distortion products in weakly non-linear systems has been mainly relying on simplified sinusoidal analysis.  While this analysis has the advantage of being simple enough to be usable in hand calculation or in spreadsheets, it produces good predictions results only for narrowband signals containing a strong carrier (FM, AM, …), but it is inadequate to predict the distortion effect on wide-band signals that have statistics similar to band-pass noise, like OFDM signals used in digital television (DTV) and Wireless Local Access Networks (WLAN).  Several analysis has been performed in literature during the last 50 years to overcome the limitation of simple sinusoidal distortion analysis, but the math involved is generally quite complex and because of the wide availability of CAD and computation tools, system designers generally prefer to rely on time-domain simulations.  This work, present a method to calculate the exact effect of distortion on wide-band signal signal that have Gaussian-like characteristics, including the determination of the exact power of the distortion products, and the prediction of effects like spectral corruption and spectral regrowth, that are not predictable by traditional sinusoidal analysis.  It is important to note that, even if this method is based on results of advanced mathematics (Hermite polynomials), its results are simple enough to be usable in hand calculations, similar to sinusoidal distortion analysis.  Moreover, the method can be use to calculate the exact power spectrum of the output of a non-linear system when a band-pass signal of non-negligible bandwidth and approximated by a Gaussian wide-sense stationary (WSS) random process is applied to its input, using simple matrix mathematics and without the need of a time-domain simulation.

Cognitive Radio Transceiver Chips (SSCS Distinguished Lecture)
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A Cognitive Radio transceiver senses its radio environment and adaptively utilizes free parts of the radio spectrum. CMOS IC-technology is the mainstream technology to implement smart signal processing and for reasons of cost and size it is attractive to also integrate the radio frequency (RF) hardware in CMOS. This lecture discusses radio transceiver ICs designed for cognitive radio applications, with focus on analog RF. Cognitive radio asks for new functionality, e.g. spectrum sensing and more agility in the radio transmitter and flexibility in the receiver. Moreover, the technical requirements on the building blocks are more challenging than for traditional single standard applications, e.g. in bandwidth, programmability, sensing sensitivity, blocker tolerance, linearity and spurious emissions. Circuit ideas that address these challenges will be discussed, and examples of chips and their achieved performance will be given.

Challenges of Calibrated Time-Interleaved High-Speed ADCs
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The dream of moving the ADC of a communication receiver all the way to the antenna is fast becoming a reality. Recent ADCs that take advantage of time-interleaving and rely heavily on calibration enable new receiver architectures where the entire spectrum is digitized while all channelization and demodulation is done in the digital domain. Such systems that are "RF-to-Digital" have many advantages. However, the design of the requisite ADC remains a challenge to achieve wide-bandwidth and high dynamic-range at very low power. This talk introduces key concepts of calibrated time-interleaved ADCs at a tutorial level. Examples of specific solutions are presented. Advanced concepts are also introduced. Finally, students wishing to pursue this area as a research topic will be exposed to several unsolved issues and hopefully will be inspired to extend the state-of-the-art with new and creative solutions.

Microelectronic Test Structures for CMOS Technology
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
In scientific investigation and in launching a manufacturing technology through its stages of research and development, test structures are used to facilitate characterization and control of key aspects of the integrated whole. With scaling to deep sub-um dimensions, the cost and complexity of CMOS technologies continues to rise. Appropriately designed test structures add efficiency and reduce cost and time to market. Examples of innovative CMOS test structures and measurement techniques covering from DC to multi-GHz frequencies are described. Emphasis is placed on a methodology that bridges both upward in the hierarchy to complex circuitry and downward to the properties of the constituent components. The designs and concepts presented are based on the work originally done for IBM's microprocessor chip technologies[1]. </b><br>

A 48-mW 18-Gb/s Fully Integrated CMOS Optical Receiver with Photodetector and Adaptive Equalizer
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The rising demand for short-range optical links using 850-nm wavelength has generated strong interest in CMOS optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs). Compared to existing hybrid solutions employing off-chip GaAs-based avalanche photodetectors (PDs), single-chip OEICs with on-chip PDs can lower optical module assembly cost and eliminate the parasitic effects due to the bond-wire and ESD protection circuit at the receiver input. However, CMOS PDs have poor responsivity (<50 mA/W) under standard supply bias due to their shallow junction depth (~1um) relative to the 850-nm light absorption length in silicon (>15um). Moreover, typical CMOS PD bandwidth (BW) is <100 MHz limited by substantial junction capacitance and large carrier transit time in the substrate. By operating in avalanche mode, the responsivity and BW can be greatly enhanced but it requires a large bias voltage (>10 V). In general, equalization circuits are required for gain compensation to boost the data rate (DR) above 5 Gb/s. The stat-of-the-art performance demonstrated by a monolithic 850-nm optical receiver can achieve a maximum data rate of 12.5 Gb/s while consuming 4.72 pJ/bit. 
This work presents a complete 850-nm optical receiver designed in a standard 1-V 65-nm CMOS process integrating the PD, transimpedance amplifier (TIA), continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with adaptive self-controlled loop, limiting amplifier (LA), and dc offset cancellation (DOC) circuits to achieve a record performance at 18 Gb/s with 2.7 pJ/bit.

Beyond 60GHz - CMOS Circuits and Techniques for More Bandwidth, Power and Efficiency
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
With 60 GHz CMOS circuits going into products and devices that keep scaling, CMOS can now operate at 100 GHz and beyond. However, operating near or above 
the transistor ft/fmax and the dominant parasitics poses a major challenge for traditional circuit topologies. In this talk several techniques for 
generating and detecting signals at short millimeter wave frequencies with high output power, wide bandwidth and high efficiency will be discussed, 
including a Colpitts oscillator, the use of harmonics and multi-band architectures. Interfacing the chip at these frequencies through on-chip antennas and 
transitions will also be discussed. Examples of measured devices working up to 340 GHz and data rates of up to 20 GBps will be presented.

Parametric Excitation
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A time-varying capacitor embedded in suitable supporting circuitry
can be made to exhibit a negative resistance -- hence, can provide
gain, sustain an oscillation or convert energy from one frequency
to another -- all theoretically noise-free and with 100% efficiency
(because it is a lossless circuit element).Of course, there are some details and parasitic resistances degrade
the efficiency.
<br>
In this talk, I will survey some of the early history of such
parametric circuits, then show some modern circuit implementations
with possible applications to RFID tags or (very ambitious) a possible
replacement for the traveling-wave tube.
