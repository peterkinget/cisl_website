Progress on THz Electronics: Chip-Scale Wave-Matter Interactions and Large-Scale Active Arrays

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The advances of silicon-based THz electronic components, over the past few years, have unearthed a series of emerging opportunities and challenges. In particular, we need to bridge a new “THz gap” between those on-chip components and practical applications. To this end, we have demonstrated a few promising capabilities which are offered by (and probably only offered by) blending a multimodal electromagnetic design approach with highly-scalable system architectures. In this talk, we first explore sensing and metrology microsystems utilizing chip-scale wave-matter interactions. As one example, photons in THz range, although very weak, can excite rotational modes of polar gas molecules, resulting in ultra-narrow absorption spectral lines (Q=105~106). Through a high-parallelism operation, a dual-THz-frequency-comb spectrometer in CMOS minimizes the tradeoff between detection range and specificity in gas sensing, and provides ppm sensitivity for molecules like HCN. We will also show how such chip-scale wave-matter interactions enables miniature, fully-electronic frequency references. In the second part of this talk, we present our approach to construct large-scale coherent radiator arrays for high power combining and beam collimation, which are essential in THz imaging with longer range and higher spatial resolution. This is showcased in a 1-THz radiation source in SiGe, consisting of 42 oscillators and 91 coherent antennas in only 1-mm2 chip area. Its total radiated power of ~0.1mW and effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of ~20mW have advanced the prior records of silicon mid-THz work by 10x and 200x, respectively.

Sensors, Circuits, and Algorithms for Structural Health Monitoring

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Structural health monitoring (SHM) enables real-time and continuous evaluation of the health of mechanical, civil, and aerospace structures in order to detect the existence, location, and severity of potential damage. In a typical active SHM system, electrical actuation signals are generated to drive an array of piezoelectric transducers embedded in the structure, which in turn convert them to mechanical vibrations (Lamb waves) that travel along the structure. These ultrasonic guided waves are received by the same or another set of transducers, which convert them back to electrical signals. The received waveforms are further processed to analyze the health of the structure.
<br>The hardware required for SHM systems, including waveform generation, reception, digitization, and signal processing, have typically been implemented using discrete electronics. However, the size, weight, and power consumption of this approach makes it unattractive for many applications, including monitoring of aerospace structures. Minimizing the sizes of rigid electronic components is particularly important in order to ensure that the assembled sensor sheet remains mechanically compliant and conformal over curved surfaces. We have developed heterogeneous microsystems that integrate miniaturized electronics and sensors within a flexible polymer substrate to significantly reduce system size, weight, and power, thus paving the way for scalable large-area SHM systems.
<br>In this talk, we will describe i) the basic physics of both active and passive ultrasonic SHM; ii) integrated CMOS analog front-ends for miniaturized SHM sensor nodes; iii) the associated environmental compensation, damage detection, and localization algorithms, and iv) ultrasonic power and data transfer approaches for making the sensor nodes wireless and semi-autonomous. Experimental results from a variety of benchtop experiments will be used to explain and validate the concepts.

Electronic & photonic; 1+1=3

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The field of silicon electronics is becoming increasingly inter-disciplinary. It is not difficult to imagine a great synergy between the fields of silicon electronics and photonic integrated circuits in the next several years where integrated electronic-photonic co-design can profoundly impact both fields resulting in advances in several areas such as communication, signal processing, imaging, and sensing.
In this talk examples of electronic-photonics co-design where analog, RF, and mm-wave circuits and techniques are employed to improve the performance of photonic systems will be discussed. An optical synthesizer is presented which is capable of Hz-level tuning of a semiconductor laser emitting at 200THz over a 5THz range. Other examples such as integrated Pound-Drever-Hall laser frequency stabilization system, nanophotonic coherent imager, and integrated projection system will also be presented.

A System-Level Approach to Secure and Spectrum-Aware Wireless Communications
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The wireless spectrum crunch is driving the urgent need for shared spectrum access technologies to replace current, highly inefficient, fixed spectrum allocation policies. Further, security has become a critical component in future low-power wireless networks focused on connecting edge devices. The goal of my research is to develop energy-efficient systems for secure and spectrum-aware wireless communications. By working at the intersection of protocols, signal processing, device characteristics, and circuit design, I develop unique system solutions that would not be possible through isolated investigation. I focus on cross-layer optimization from circuits to protocols to drastically improve energy efficiency and obtain higher performance. In this talk, I will discuss a signal-model-driven compressed-sensing RF system that offers a novel and immensely more energy-efficient approach for the quick detection of interferers in a wideband spectrum. I develop a system-level approach that enables compressed-sensing systems to work in dynamic spectrum environments with changing sparsity conditions. Lastly, I will discuss a novel ultra-fast bit-level frequency-hopping system with data-driven channel selection for secure wireless communications.

A multi-modality CMOS cellular interfacing array for holistic cellular characterizations and cell-based drug screening

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Cells are highly complex systems that often exhibit multi-physics responses under external stimulus. To achieve holistic cellular characterizations, it is essential to create interfaces that can provide (1) single-cell resolution, (2) multi-modality interfacing with cells, (3) real-time two-way communication (sensing and actuation), (4) compatibility with high throughput massively parallel operations, and (5) possibility of production at commercial quantities. The nanometer-scale complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process is a potential candidate to realize cell-microelectronics interfaces. Electronics-based computations and signal processing, such as machine learning methods, may drastically relax the requirement on the physical interface and lead to further pixel miniaturization.
<br>In this talk, we will present several fully integrated multi-modality CMOS cellular joint sensor/actuator arrays with multiple sensing modalities in every array pixel to characterize different cell physiological responses, including extracellular voltage recording, cellular impedance mapping, and optical detection with shadow imaging and bioluminescence sensing. Each pixel also contains electrical voltage/current excitation for cellular stimulation. These reported CMOS cellular joint sensor/actuator arrays comprise up-to 22k multi-modality pixels on each chip with spatial resolution down to 17um*17um/pixel, achieving single-cell resolution. Multi-modality cellular sensing at the pixel level is supported, which enables holistic cell characterization and concurrent joint-modality physiological monitoring on the same cellular sample. Comprehensive biological experiments with different living cell samples demonstrate the functionality.

Body Area Network – Connecting things together around the body

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Chronic diseases account for over 1/3 of deaths around the world. To mitigate the impact of such diseases, healthcare paradigm is now shifting from reactive illness management towards proactive and preemptive health management; the goal here is to maintain a healthy life in the first place or to prevent illness from getting any worse by continuously monitoring health during normal daily life. Body Area Network (BAN) is an attractive means for continuous and pervasive health monitoring, yet its unique and harsh environment gives circuit designers many challenges.  As human body absorbs the majority of RF energy around GHz band, existing RF radio may not be an ideal for communications between and on-body sensors. In order solve the issues, this talk covers two types of BAN: body coupled-based and wired/fabric-based. Body-coupled based BAN utilizes human body itself as a communication medium, where the lecture will begin with channel characteristics, followed by design considerations and transceiver implementation examples. For the wired/fabric based BAN, we will cover several flexible platforms that enable BAN, and discuss what and how circuit designers should consider such non-conventional environments. Low energy circuit techniques to overcome their limitations will also be discussed. We will then will review their various system aspects.

Abstract:
</b><br>
There are plenty of intriguing physical phenomena around us: from wave propagation in ocean to the movement of roller-coasters. These everyday examples can be used as inspiration in analog and RF circuit design. In this talk, we will show three examples of novel circuits that can achieve a much better performance compared to the conventional circuit topologies. The examples are focused on high speed, broadband, and low noise circuits.
