					Simplified current-steering DAC design for lower power and increased settling time using half rate clocking
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
					Digital to analog converters have found their way into a variety of applications from static control loops, offset adjustments, baseband signal synthesis and increasingly for direct RF signal synthesis. As the output signal frequency increases, the DAC aspect that limits spectral performance (distortion) changes, bringing up new design goals. This talk starts by discussing DAC designs for DC to low frequency output signals and moves on to discuss design goals for high output frequencies. In this vein I present a new technique targeted at alleviating incomplete settling issues for high speed DACs, utilizing half rate clocking of a quad switch. By halving the frequency, the settling time allowed for clocks at the switches (as well as signals within the whole datapath) is doubled, reducing data dependencies for improved performance.

His interests are in both analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter design as well as serial high speed serial interfaces required by both of these blocks.

									Synthesizing accurate clocks with inaccurate components
								

								</span>
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Abstract:</b><br>
								
								Generating precise clocks using clumsy transistors available in highly-scaled CMOS technologies is a challenging task. In this talk, several architectural- and circuit-level techniques that seek to overcome the detrimental impact of analog circuit imperfections that plague conventional clock generators will be discussed. After a brief overview of the drawbacks of classical analog phase-locked loops (PLLs), the talk progresses with the evolutionary presentation of highly digital clock generators. Several case studies of digital PLLs that achieve sub-ps absolute jitter, better than 1mW/GHz power efficiency and very wide operating range will be presented. Application of digital PLLs for supply noise cancellation and charge recycling will be outlined.

												Statistical SPICE Modeling Using Backward Propagation of Variance (BPV)


										</span>
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Abstract:</b><br>

											A key factor in IC design is to be able to determine the expected manufacturing variations that will arise in key measures of the electrical performance of circuits. This requires accurate statistical circuit simulation models. The different types of statistical models that are required for different types of statistical circuit analyses will be reviewed (including distributional models, corner models, and mismatch models), and the advantages and disadvantages of common approaches to generating these models will be discussed. The backward propagation of variance (BPV) technique will be covered in detail, showing that it almost "cheats" by force-fitting a model to give the desired results. Extension to handle explicit fitting of correlations will be covered, and it will be shown that circuit variations, as well as device distributions, can be included in the BPV modeling process.

												Neuromorphic Chip Design with a Scalable Architecture for Learning in Networks of Spiking Neurons


										</span>
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Abstract:</b><br>

											We present a scalable integrated circuit platform for networks of spiking neurons. The proposed platform incorporates (a) robust digital neuron circuits that exploit CMOS scaling; (b) novel transposable SRAM arrays that share learning circuits; and (c) crossbar fan-out for efficient on-chip inter-neuron communication. Through tight integration of memory (synapses) and computation (neurons), a highly configurable chip comprising 256 neurons and 64K binary synapses with on-chip learning based on spike-timing dependent plasticity is demonstrated in 45nm SOI-CMOS. Near-threshold, event-driven operation at 0.53V is demonstrated to maximize power efficiency for real-time pattern classification, recognition, and associative memory tasks. Future scalable systems built from the foundation provided by this work will open up possibilities for future brain-like computing systems.

												Interferer Robust Wide-band Receiver Techniques (EDS/SSCS Distinguished Lecture)


										</span>
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Abstract:</b><br>

											

										Software defined radios are radios which can send and receive according to many standards with one piece of hardware. This hardware can be configured by software and is preferably integrated in an IC. Challenges in this type of radio are: wide band RF operation or wide-RF band tunable operation. This means that RF filtering is relaxed and in turn this makes the robustness to interference a great challenge.  In this presentation several techniques will be given to increase interference robustness. Key ideas are presented in: Avoiding voltage gain at RF, 2-step harmonic rejection technique and a translational loop feedback receiver. Also a revival of N-path filters is presented, which allow tunable, linear and low-noise high-Q filters at GHz frequencies in standard CMOS.

					Large-scale EM simulation for RF IC design
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
					

Accurate modeling of passive components and passive component ensembles is a critical
step in high-speed design. In this talk, we will discuss some of the recent enhancements
in our full-wave 3D electromagnetic simulator EMX. We discuss the various simulation
and design issues that arise in the modeling of passive structures, such as, handling
density dependent effects at sub 40nm nodes, simulation of 60GHz circuitry, modeling of
thru-silicon-vias and the creation of scalable models for components. EMX is being used
for simulation and modeling of a wide class of passive circuits including spiral inductors,
MIM/MOM capacitors, Baluns, Filters, VCOs and RF Blocks and circuit ensembles.
Several designs, fabricated on a variety of process technologies ranging from 0.25um to
28nm CMOS, SiGe and high-resistivity substrates, will be presented with comparisons to
measurement.

					<b>Abstract:</b><br>


Future Long Haul optics and high-density chip-to-chip I/O communication systems would require nonlinear equalization in the digital domain. 
With technology scaling and less analog options in modern CMOS technologies there is a clear evolution path towards ADC-DSP centric 
wired/wireless communication systems. The talk will address the design challenges and calibration techniques for high data rate ADCs
realized in CMOS SOI technologies from IBM. Design trade-offs will identify fundamental limits and voltage domain / time domain analog-to-digital 
converter systems are discussed with their advantages and shortcomings.

Prospects of Semiconductor on Insulator (SOI) Technology in Power Amplifiers and Integrated Nanoelectromechanical Systems 
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>

Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology has been widely used for low power analog and digital circuits for applications in mobile computation and communication. An addition of a buried oxide layer beneath a thin Si device layer in SOI technology brings about a new physics to the CMOS transistor, one that is still not fully understood.  The buried oxide layer reduces the parasitic capacitance of transistors and interconnect metallizations to the Si substrate, which in turn reduces the dynamic power dissipation. Moreover, the buried oxide layer, when combined with trench oxide, helps electrically isolate CMOS transistors from each other and from the Si substrate. Electrically isolated SOI transistors can be stacked on top of each other to form power amplifiers with large output voltage swings. On the other hand, buried oxide layer facilitates micromachining of thin Silicon Nanowires that can be easily made into suspended double-clamped nanoelectromechanical resonators. With excellent control over the fabrication process, these mechanical resonators are made reliable, reproducible and widely tunable. In addition, they can be excited in their nonlinear dynamics modes including parametric amplification and resonance modes. In this presentation, SOI applications in both power amplifiers and integrated Nanoelectromechanical systems are revisited and our most recent results are presented.

Activities in passive and active submm-wave imaging at VTT / MilliLab 
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
					Both active and passive submillimetre-wave stand-off imaging systems are under development for security imaging applications. The drivers for operation at higher frequencies have been the desire for better image resolution, smaller optics package, reduced susceptibility to specular reflections from the human skin and capability for stand-off imagery. In the talk I summarize our efforts on devices, components and systems which could eventually pave the way for fast, real time, high-resolution imaging systems for the submillimetre-wave range.

Dr Luukanen’s professional career began as a research assistant at Metorex International Oy, a Finnish company specializing in analytical X-ray instruments for the metal industry and a supplier of X-ray detectors for several space science missions of the European Space Agency ESA, NASA, and NASDA. In 1996, Arttu Luukanen began investigating technologies for passive millimeter wave imaging for concealed weapons detection. This research culminated in passive scanned imagery of objects taken with an imaging system utilizing antenna-coupled microbolometers as the detectors. Dr Luukanen continued his bolometer research as a graduate student at the University of Jyväskylä, Department of Physics under a joint ESA contract with Metorex. His Ph.D. research focussed on the development of ultra-sensitive transition-edge microcalorimeters and microbolometers for X-ray and THz sensing applications. After completing his Ph.D., Dr Luukanen took a research scientist position at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. From 2003 to 2005 he worked as a guest researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado (USA), developing an active millimetre-wave imaging system based on antenna-coupled microbolometers. In 2005, Dr Luukanen was nominated as the Director of MilliLab, the Millimetre Wave Laboratory of Finland (www.vtt.fi/millilab). Since 2006, Dr Luukanen has served as the chairman of IEEE Electron Devices/Microwave Theory & Techniques and Antennas & propagation Chapters of the IEEE Finland Section.

From Microwave to Millimeter-wave: The Design of Reconfigurable, High-Bandwidth CMOS Radios
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
From Microwave to Millimeter-wave: The Design of Reconfigurable, High-Bandwidth CMOS Radios
The first part of this talk describes the application of phase-change vias to reconfigure CMOS integrated circuits. CMOS-compatible phase-change materials feature high contrasts in resistivity between the amorphous and crystalline states. While this property is being exploited in an emerging class of non-volatile memories, we are exploring its utility as a technological element to reconfigure integrated circuits, especially analog and RF circuits. The development of CMOS-compatible reconfigurable inductors, their application in a reconfigurable LC-VCO, as well as the underlying material choices and integration techniques are discussed. Other reconfigurable CMOS circuits including a low-offset comparator and a non-volatile look-up table are described. Characterization results from prototype circuits are presented to validate these concepts.
<br>The second part of this talk addresses the design of low-power millimeter-wave radios in CMOS with extremely wide bandwidths. The mm-wave frequency bands hold enormous potential for multi-Gb/s communications as well as emerging imaging and ranging applications. The realization of this potential will be underpinned by the development of high-performance, power-efficient transceivers in nanoscale CMOS technologies. Two key challenges must be met towards achieving this goal. First, the mm-wave front-end circuits must be designed to operate over extremely wide bandwidths of several tens of GHz, both to exploit the large bandwidth availability, and also to provide sufficient margins to tolerate process, voltage and temperature variations that are increasingly problematic in nanoscale CMOS. Second, reducing power consumption in the front-end is imperative especially since phased-arrays are mandated in mm-wave transceivers.
<br>This latter half of this talk describes our recent work towards achieving these goals. Transformer-based unilateralization techniques are introduced to enable the design of low-noise amplifiers that achieve over 10 GHz of bandwidth and can operate from a scalable power supply from the nominal voltage down to very low voltages. Low-voltage, ultra-wide bandwidth receivers for pulse-based mm-wave signals, and phased-array receivers, based on the aforementioned amplifiers, are presented. The design of transformer-based voltage-controlled oscillators with several 10's of GHz of tuning range is then described. Results from the characterization of several test circuits in 130 nm and 45 nm CMOS technologies are presented.

Time-domain ADCs for Digital-Intensive RF Receivers and Health-care ICs for Non-electrical Vital Sign Monitoring
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
 In the first part of the talk, a time-domain ADC using voltage-controlled oscillators will be presented for a digital-intensive direct RF sampling receiver. Unlike conventional delta-sigma band-pass ADCs that require high speed analog circuits and passive components, the proposed architecture provides band-pass function by time-interleaving 1st-order noise-shaped VCO-based ADCs. The use of VCO-based ADC has the advantage that its resolution is determined by time-resolution rather than the voltage resolution, thus making it attractive for future low-voltage CMOS processes. In the second part of the talk, a technique to monitor pulse-wave velocity and respiration will be presented. By exploiting the change of electrical impedance in human body, we will show that such non-electrical vital signs from human body can be measured in an all electrical way.
