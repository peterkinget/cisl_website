Title: A High Dynamic Range 2.5 GHz Fourth-Order Tunable LC 0.5 um CMOS
Bandpass Filter
            </font>
            <p>Abstract:
            </p>
            <p>Among different topologies for RF bandpass filters,
active LC type filter is a good candidate as it can provide a high
quality factor (Q) bandpass transfer function with significant reduced
power consumption and higher dynamic range in comparison to Gm-C type
filters. Mutually coupled inductors is an attractive way to realize
impedance transformation and more immune to process variations.
Regardless of the coupling mechanism between the resonators, losses
associated with the on-chip reactive components change the center
frequency and loaded quality factor of the filter.
An enhanced high dynamic range CMOS fourth-order LC type RF bandpass
filter is presented. The magnetically coupled resonators are emulated
based on the electric coupling between two individual inductors.
Coupling coefficient can be changed to tune the bandwidth of the
filter. The proposed electrically coupled resonators scheme is not
based on a resistive sensor path to couple the two resonators. This
reduces the noise and increases significantly the dynamic range of the
filter. The filter has been implemented in AMI 0.5 um CMOS process and
occupies an area of 0.15 mm2. The prototype operates at a center
frequency of 2.5GHz with a bandwidth of 92MHz, and a passband gain of
11dB and 25dB of image attenuation for an IF frequency of 100MHz. It
draws less than 16mA current from a single 2.7-V supply. The measured
IM3 is -38dBm for two tones applied at 2.5GHz and 2.51GHz with equal
amplitudes of -38dBm. The measured 1-dB output compression point is
-32dBm. The measured output noise is -84dBm in a 100MHz filter's
bandwidth which results in a 52dB dynamic range and 32dB noise figure. </p>

Title: A Differential Scheme for LDMOS Power Transistor Class-AB
Biasing Using
On-Chip Transconductance Replicas
      </font>
      <p>Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>We describe a new principle for biasing LDMOS class-AB power
amplifiers,
using on-chip gm replicas for setting and maintaining a
constant gm ratio over temperature and process variations. The
conventional constant quiescent drain current condition is
automatically
met over temperature and improved linearity statistical spread is
achieved over transistor fabrication variations. Fully differential
operation ensures insensitivity to RF leakage.

Title: Energy-Efficient Bioelectronics
      </font>
      <p>Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>Biomedical systems such as fully implanted prosthetics for the
deaf, blind or paralyzed require decades of operation on a small
battery. Neurobiological systems use impressively few resources of
energy, space, and time to solve complex sensory and sensorimotor tasks
and provide inspiration for energy efficient electronic design. First,
I will describe research on high-performance, ultra-low-power silicon
chips inspired by the biological cochlea. Such chips have applications
in various domains where spectral analysis in noisy environments is
essential such as in bionic implants for the deaf or in speech
recognition. I will demonstrate an application from this research, an
all-analog soon-to-go-commercial bionic ear processor with such low
power consumption that a conventional A-D-then-DSP technique will not
be able to beat it two decades in the future. This processor will
enable 30 year operation on a small 100mAh battery in fully implanted
cochlear implants of the future. Then, I will outline applications of
bioelectronics to some other domains such as novel companding
processors for speech recognition in noise, RF cochleas for ultra wide
band radios, MEMS cochleas, analog memory for adaptive systems, RF ID
tags, machine vision systems and robotics.

Title: Transceiver Design for High Speed Optical Interconnects
      </font>
      <p>Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>The increasing speed of on-chip data processing and
computation create a
growing demand for high-bandwidth input and output (IO) to VLSI
circuits.
However, increasing the bandwidth of electrical signaling with the same
rate is becoming very challenging. The possibility of using optics for
interconnection at short distances has been recently a subject of
considerable research and analysis. A very promising design platform is
to
hybrid integrate dense arrays of optical devices (lasers, modulators
and
detectors) with commercial electronic circuits to establish a very high
data rate, parallel link for chip-to-chip interconnection. Such a
system
requires receiver and transmitter circuitry that is very small and has
low
power consumption. This talk describes the design and implementation of
CMOS transceivers
suitable for parallel optical interconnects with flip-chip-bonded
optical
devices. The receiver front-end uses a novel double
sampling/integrating
scheme with 1:5 demultiplexing to avoid having to build a
transimpedance
amplifier that runs at the bit rate. In this design the optically
generated current is integrated onto the parasitic capacitor of the
input
node and voltage-samples are compared for data recovery. Moreover
rather
than using the standard 2x oversampled approach for clock recovery,
this
receiver uses a new baud-rate CDR based only on data samples, to reduce
both complexity and power consumption. Our transceiver test chip
achieves
data rates as high as 5Gb/s and consumes less than 145mW of power per
link
in a 0.25 um CMOS technology. At the end, scaling to future
technologies
and potential extension of these techniques for future research will be
briefly discussed.

Title: Millimeter-Wave Circuits and Systems: An Emerging Opportunity
for
SiGe
      </font>
      <p>Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>SiGe technology has advanced to the point that the devices can
now operate at millimeter-wave frequencies. Silicon's economy of scale
promises high levels of integration and thereby reduced system cost,
which
in turn could open up new market opportunities. Promising applications
include automotive radar at 77 GHz and near Gbps personal-area networks
and
point-to-point links at 60 GHz. This talk will provide an overview of
millimeter-wave applications and design methodologies, and then focus
on
60-GHz transceiver circuits which have been successfully realized in a
0.12-um SiGe bipolar technology. Some of the results include a 60-GHz
LNA
with 15-dB gain and 4.5-dB NF, a 60-GHz direct-downconverter with 18-dB
gain and 13-dB NF, a 60-GHz power amplifier with +11.2-dBm P1dB and
4.3%
PAE, and a 67-GHz VCO with -98 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1-MHz offset. In
addition to the circuit results, the talk will also highlight antenna,
package, and passive component development for millimeter-wave.<br>

Title: Microscale Integrated Acoustic Source Separation and
Localization
      </font></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
Abstract:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I will present mixed-signal VLSI
adaptive microsystems interfacing with
miniature microphone arrays that perform acoustic source separation and
localization at microwatts of power, for use in intelligent hearing
aids
and acoustic surveillance. Analog gradient sensing of the broadband
traveling wave field at sub-wavelength scale across a planar array of
sensors yields linearly mixed instantaneous observations of multiple
sources, blindly separated and 3-D localized using independent
component
analysis. The principle extends directly to the radio-frequency domain
for low-power separation and localization of multiple broadband users
in
wireless networks.
