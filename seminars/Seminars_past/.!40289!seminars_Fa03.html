Title: Large Scale Full-Wave Extraction for RF and High-Speed IC Design
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Accurate modeling of interconnect parasitics, passive components and
passive component ensembles is a critical step in high-speed
design. Traditional full Maxwell equation field solvers originating
from the microwave community are accurate but are very inefficient and
hence impractical to use for IC design.  The current class of
quasi-static solution techniques developed in the CAD community are
efficient but often cannot meet the high-accuracy requirements of RF
design.
We introduce a new extraction tool EMX (ElectroMagnetic eXtractor) for
the analysis of RF, analog and high-speed digital circuits.  EMX uses
a new version of a generalized Fast Multipole Method.  It is a fast,
integral-equation based, full-wave field solver which takes advantage
of the layout ``regularity'' in typical design. In addition, a new
formulation for the implementation of the vector Maxwell's equations
is developed that significantly reduces computing resources.  EMX is
one to two orders of magnitude faster than the current class of
approaches for solving similar problems.
A number of designs such as inductors, Baluns, VCOs and RF Blocks have
been simulated and designed with EMX and we show the comparison to
measurement.

Title:  Communications Systems on a Chip in the Post-Bubble Era
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>

In the late 90's, communications was the fastest growing segment of the semiconductor industry driven by the internet boom and a perceived need for increased transmission, switching and processing capacity. Silicon providers focused on increasing port speed along with a reduced time to market. When the bubble burst, service providers cut back severely on capital expenditure and now look for new ways to increase revenue while reducing operating cost. In this new environment, silicon 'system on a chip' technology offers the possibility of increased functionality and flexibility while reducing overall system cost. This will be achieved using a combination of higher levels of integration, embedded software, reconfigurable hardware and new packaging technologies. 

This talk describes a number of examples of how system on a chip technology can be used to improve functionality while reducing overall cost in wired, wireless and storage applications. These examples will be used to identify some major architectural and implementation trends. Finally, we will take a look at some of the key challenges facing communication chip designers moving forward.

Title: Silicon Chips for MIMO Receivers
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>

One of the big advances in wireless communication in recent times involves the use of multiple transmit
antennas to realize enormous gains in spectral efficiency. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless 
systems generalize the concept of the Bell Labs Layed Space-Time (BLAST) coding scheme for spatial multiplexing. 
This talk will highlight algorithms and architectures for MIMO receivers that have been used to implement 
practical MIMO receivers in silicon. The results are shown in the context of the high speed downlink 
packet access (HSDPA) extension of UMTS for 3rd generation mobile communication, with a silicon chip 
that can achieve up to 28.8 Mb/s over a 5 MHz channel using up to a 4x4 QPSK MIMO configuration (5.76 bits/s/Hz). 
Some of the significant challenges include dealing with the self-interference caused by the loss of 
orthogonality between the spreading codes from a frequency-selective channel and implementing exponentially 
complex maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO detection algorithms efficiently in hardware. The talk will describe 
the key features of the ASIC and present some preliminary over-the-air measurements that attest to the 
performance of MIMO for HSDPA. Furthermore, the talk will highlight future implementation techniques for
