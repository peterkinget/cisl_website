<FONT color=#ff0000>Low Noise Pulse Processing ASICs for Particle
                   and Radiation Detectors
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
        Integrated circuit front ends are used extensively in both
research and commercial applications of radiation detectors. Examples
range from particle physics, where modern detectors involve tens of
millions of sensors accumulating data at rates of terabytes per second, to
handheld nuclear medicine probes used to guide surgery. Key circuit design
goals are: power-constrained front-end noise optimization, high precision
voltage and time measurements in a mixed-signal VLSI environment,
radiation tolerance, and high-density interconnect to the sensors. This
talk will describe some CMOS circuit techniques developed to achieve these
goals. The expected impact of CMOS scaling on future analog performance
will also be discussed.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Nano-scale CMOS Technology
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
The growth of the semiconductor IC industry over the past few decades has
been fueled by continued scaling of transistors to enable higher packing
density, faster circuit speed, and lower power dissipation. New materials
and device structures are needed to continue the CMOS performance trend. In
this talk, I will discuss some of the technology options for nano-scale
CMOS technology. These options include ultra-thin channel single- and
double-gate MOSFETs and alternative materials for the channels and gate
stacks.

<FONT color=#ff0000> Signal processing techniques for optical communications</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
This talk will give an overview of well-known signal processing
techniques used in lower speed wireline and wireless applications,
applied to high-speed optical communications. After an introduction on
today's optical network architecture and optical channel impairments,
we review modulation techniques for optical communications, fiber
equalization, forward error correction, with special emphasis on VLSI
implementation.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Advances in circuit technologies and techniques for optical systems at 40
Gb/s and beyond
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Optical transmission systems based on 40 Gb/s E-TDM are nearing their
commercial
introduction. The push for higher payload date rate has spurred interest in
optical systems with single-channel capacity beyond 40 Gb/s.  Reaching such
high
data rates will require further improvements not only in electronics,
but also in packaging, O/E-E/O conversion and measurements.
In our talk, we will focus on the electronics and give an overview of the
strengths of different semiconductor technologies needed to build transmitters

and receivers at 40 Gb/s and beyond. We will give a number of analog and
digital
circuit examples, mainly based on InP and SiGe HBT's.
