Abstract:
<P>
As a consequence of a variety of constraints, many subjects in science and
engineering education do not include a laboratory experience. Yet, hands-on
laboratory exercises can substantially enhance education effectiveness. At
MIT, we are harnessing Internet technology to enable students to remotely
access real laboratories and carry out experiments from anywhere at any
time. This talk will describe and demonstrate the MIT Microelectronics
WebLab, an online microelectronics device characterization laboratory. It
will also discuss educational experiments carried out using WebLab from
MIT, Singapore, and Sweden.

Death, Taxes and Failing Chips
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
In the way they cope with variability, present-day
methodologies are onerous, pessimistic and risky, all at the same time!
Dealing with variability is an increasingly important aspect of
high-performance digital integrated circuit design, and indispensable
for first-time-right hardware and cutting-edge performance.  The
presentation will discuss the methodology, analysis, synthesis and
modeling aspects of this problem.  These aspects of the problem will be
compared and contrasted in the ASIC and custom (microprocessor) domains.
Particular attention will be paid to statistical timing analysis;
desirable attributes that would render such an analysis capability
practical and accurate will be enumerated.  The algorithms and
activities being pursued in IBM to solve the statistical timing problem
will be briefly discussed.

Recent developments in LC-tuned VCO design
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
With the emerging market for the wireless LAN standards 802.11a and g,
the need exists to provide radio solutions that integrate these
standards together with the popular "b"-standard into a single
receiver. These so called "combo"-solutions pose stringent
requirements on the radio's VCO in terms of phase noise and tuning
range. Preferably a single VCO, in combination with selectable
frequency division, provides the capability of covering all RF bands
(respectively 2.412-2.484GHz and 5.18-5.805GHz for the b,g and a
standard).
<P>
This talk will highlight some recent developments in the design of LC
tuned VCOs. The first part of the talk will deal with the role that
the varactor plays in the tuning linearity and noise upconversion of
LC-tuned VCOs.  The topics addressed will include: tuning dependency
on bias current, linearization of the tuning curve when using
varactors with an abrupt C(V) characteristic, bias noise upconversion
by the varactor through AM-and CMM-to-PM conversion, and differential
tuning as a way to reduce noise upconversion.
<P>
The second part of the talk will deal with quadrature oscillators.  It
will be shown how quadrature oscillators can be used with advantage in
potential 802.11 architectures.  After a brief overview of existing
quadrature VCO topologies, an alternative concept of quadrature
coupling of LC oscillators is introduced. It uses injection-locking
through common mode inductive coupling to enforce quadrature. The
technique provides quadrature over a wide tuning range without
introducing any phase noise or power consumption increase.

Building a New Framework for Deep Submicron Analog/RF
                CMOS Design and Beyond 
                
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
At the present time, analog and RF CMOS design suffer from a variety
of self-imposed constraints which severely limit both the efficiency
of the design process and the capabilities of product ICs. These
constraints are not real, but are instead self-inflicted due to the
continued use of a design infrastructure which has been overstretched
and which has outlived its usefulness. At its roots, the problem is
one of an overly deconstructed and segmented approach to the MOS
transistor in understanding, modeling, usage, and design
implementation.
<P>
This presentation will outline a fundamental rebuilding and
re-generalization of the entire approach to describing the MOS
transistor and the methods by which the ubiquitous MOSFET is used in
circuit design. Rather than being split up into separate pieces, this
new approach involves the construction of an overarching structure
through which process technology, modeling, design usage, and design
optimization all become part of one coherent whole. It will be shown
that not only can the MOS transistor be interpreted in a much simpler
and more comprehensible fashion, but that this interpretation is
universal across processes and technologies. Some examples, taken from
real situations where ICs have been designed and sold in large
quantities, will be described, clearly demonstrating how many of the
self-imposed constraints of older methods can be broken, allowing for
fuller use of the capabilities of modern deep-submicron CMOS
technology. Finally it will be noted that by this generalization of
the behavior of the MOS transistor, the methods thus developed can be
generalized beyond CMOS to future nanotechnology devices.

Challenges and Opportunities for Mixed Signal Systems 
                in Sub 100nm CMOS Technologies
                
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
The continued scaling of CMOS transistors provides significant
challenges and opportunities for designers of mixed signal systems. We
will review scaling trends and discuss its implications for incipient
mixed signal systems. Using examples drawn from high- speed digital,
low frequency as well as Radio frequency analog design applications,
we will describe the impact of reducing voltages while simultaneously
increasing leakage currents. We will also discuss, the space of
realizable systems in the context of available device bandwidth and
integration levels.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design With Floating-Gate MOS 
                Transistors

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
We design in the era of the ever shinking power supply.  Many of the basic 
tried-and-true cells that are in our textbooks are or will soon be rendered 
unuseable due to this unrelenting downward march of Vdd.  In the face of 
such challenges, some have suggested that floating-gate MOS (FGMOS) 
transistors are useful devices for designing low-voltage circuits, mainly 
because they offer us the possibility of lowering their threshold voltages 
by programming their floating-gate charges appropriately.  However, since 
Shibata's introduction of the neuron MOS concept, we have realized that 
FGMOS transistors have more to offer than programmable threshold voltages.  
We can capacitively couple as many control gates as we would like into the 
floating gate of a FGMOS transistor, which opens up to us many new circuit 
topologies, many of which are very quite attractive for operation on a low 
power supply voltage.  In this talk, I will discuss some of our recent 
efforts in charting this new design space.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Internally Varying Analog Circuits:
                A Means for Minimizing Power Dissipation

</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
This talk examines the fundamental reasons for the large power
dissipation of dynamical analog circuits with large dynamic range. It is
shown that by allowing the internal attributes of circuits to vary in an
appropriate manner, such fundamental limitations can be bypassed in certain
cases. The talk reviews several techniques, developed by the analog group of
CISL in
the past several years, which make possible internally
varying analog circuits with invariant external behavior. These techniques
include
companding, dynamic biasing, and dynamic impedance scaling. Experimental
results from recently developed chips, which demonstrate over an order of
magnitude improvement compared to the state of the art,  are
described.

<FONT color=#ff0000>High-Speed Link Technology Research at IBM
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Advanced silicon technologies have opened the doors to implement very
high-speed links for electrical, optical and wireless connections.
In parallel to higher bandwidth requirements, there is also a pressing need
for higher levels of integration in the wired and wireless communication
fields to bring the cost and power dissipation down while still complying
with stringent link requirements such as sensitivity, jitter and
bit-error-rate.
<P>
In this talk, we will review the research activities undertaken by the
Communication Circuits and Systems
department at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY in the
area of multi-Gb/s and microwave links using CMOS and SiGe technologies.

<FONT color=#ff0000>Power-Performance Efficiency Studies
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Power has emerged recently as a primary design variable in high-end
microprocessors. Naive focus on performance leads the system design into
inefficient power-performance operation. In order to design more
effectively it is important to have power-performance measures to guide the
design from technology through circuit design to micrarchitecture. The
first part of the presentation highlights hardware intensity, a measure of
the power-performance efficiency of a circuit design. Relations are derived
using this measure which have practical consequences for power budgeting
and for joint circuit-microarchitecture tradeoffs. The second part of the
presentation focusses on adding power to the analysis of microarchitectural
pipelining. The results illustrate the hazards of ignoring power, and the
major impact it can have on optimal pipelining. The talk concludes with
speculations on further research opportunities in this area.

<FONT color=#ff0000>The Future of Electrical Backplanes: High-Speed at Low-Cost
</FONT>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Backplanes contain a lot of interconnect to connect several system parts.
The required data bandwidth of interfaces within/between systems continues
to grow and therefore there is always a drive to increase backplane
communication speed. Sometimes the question is posed whether this type of
communication will be replaced by optical links soon.
<P>
This presentation shows that electrical is certainly not at its end of
life.  Proper signalling, transmission lines and characteristic design can
boost the performance to 10Gb/s/channel (and probably beyond). Furthermore
electrical has certainly a strong advance: low-cost. The presentation
discusses several bus and signalling concepts, shows problems and
limitations, but also solutions and opportunities for the future enabled
by technology improvements. Optical links seem not really competitive yet
for this kind of application. This brings up the conclusion that (new)
electrical links remain the preferred solution for the foreseeable future.
