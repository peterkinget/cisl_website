Superconducting Single Flux Quantum Electronics: Solving Energy Problem in High-End Computing

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The explosive growth of the Internet transformed data centers into large industrial scale computer facilities with extraordinarily high energy demands. From Google and Facebook to banking, cloud computing and supercomputing, an average data center already use as much electricity as a medium-size town. Besides just high energy costs, there is a compelling technical reason to improve energy efficiency of computing technologies. The development of the next generations of high-end computers will not be possible unless a significant improvement in energy efficiency is achieved over the technology available today. The heart of the problem is in a relatively low energy-efficiency of current computer circuit technologies consuming too much energy for computing, storing and moving data between processors and memories. Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) technology is viewed as a possible Beyond-Silicon technology at a relatively matured stage of the development. I will review several key innovations happened just within last few years which dramatically increased a potential of superconductivity addressing known critical problems which prevented the use of superconductivity in high-end computing in the past.  Superconducting SFQ digital circuits by virtue of their inherent low power dissipation, high speed, lossless interconnect present an excellent opportunity to dramatically increase energy efficiency of high-end computing.  The long-standing memory problem is being addressed by a new class of cryogenic spintronics devices capable of co-integration with SFQ circuits and new superconducting spintronics elements, in which competing superconducting and magnetic order parameters co-exist to deliver new opportunities for electronics.

Enabling Self-powered IoT Devices Using Ultra-low Power Circuits and Systems

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Wearable electronics, intelligent devices, medical electronics, and more recently Internet of Things (IoTs) are dramatically changing the way we experience life by providing rich information about our activities, health, and the environment. To be truly ubiquitous, these devices must be energy autonomous. Such a system must harvest energy from ambient sources like light, vibration, temperature differentials, etc. and must also be very efficient in using the little energy available to it for computation. This talk focuses on how to enable perpetual, self-sustaining ultra-low power systems. We will discuss circuits that can harvest energy efficiently from the smallest ambient sources, and ultra-low power analog and mixed signal circuits such as voltage references, clock generators and regulators. We will also talk about the need for an ultra-low power system architecture where energy takes the center stage in defining the architecture and not performance as in traditional systems.  Finally, we will discuss the use of ultra-low power systems for the development of bio-electronics and neurological systems, and power-electronics with an emphasis on the use of renewable energy.

Microelectronics for Radiation Detectors

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Radiation detectors find application in several areas, the most prominent being medical imaging, national security, safeguard, and physics research. In order to achieve a high resolution, these detectors require specialized low-noise electronics, also known as front-end electronics. This seminar presents the most relevant technical and non-technical aspects of front-end electronics design for radiation detectors. The concepts of low-noise charge amplification, pulse shaping and equivalent noise charge are introduced.
<br>
Front-end application-specific integrated circuits are regarded as a critical enabling technology without which both present and future radiation detector developments would be impossible. The deep knowledge of this specialized front-end design has traditionally belonged to a very limited number of research groups and institutions worldwide. A major challenge comes from the dramatic increase in demand, combined with the need for higher resolving capability, functionality and portability. These stringent requirements push the state-of-the-art to the limit and calls for continuous innovation. The rapid evolution of front-end ASICs is discussed and state-of-the-art developments are shown.
<br><br><b>

</b><br>
Gianluigi De Geronimo received his Ph.D. in microelectronics from Milan Polytechnic in 1997. Shortly after that he joined the Instrumentation Division of Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY, where he specialized in the design of front-end integrated circuits for radiation detectors. He successfully developed several state-of-the-art ASICs implementing innovative circuits and frequently achieving record performance. He collaborates with several institutions and industries and is co-author of over 130 scientific publications and two book chapters.
<br>

Time Varying Circuits for Radio Receiver Applications
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Sharp, programmable, linear, integrated filters are enabling components for software defined and cognitive radio applications. However, they are difficult to realize: SAW and MEMS based filters are sharp and linear but not very programmable; active filters can be sharp and programmable but are not very linear; sampled charge domain filtering is sharp and programmable but the burden of the linearity is on the front end voltage-current converter. This talk descirbes an alternative approach that uses time-varying (as opposed to time-invariant) circuits to realize sharp, programmable, linear, integrated filters. The technique exploits sampling aliases to effectively realize very sharp, linear filtering prior to sampling. This talk will describe the basics of this time-varying circuit design approach and illustrates its application to radio front-ends and spectrum scanners.  Measurement results from recent prototype integrated circuits will also be presented.

Active Electromagnetics for Modern Communication Systems

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Modern communication systems are characterized by increasing demands in terms of various metrics, including low loss, power efficiency, compact size and integrability. Many of these requirements can hardly be achieved through conventional technology and require the development of new techniques. In this talk, I will show how it is possible to address these problems and design electromagnetic devices with unprecedented characteristics by using time modulation, nonlinear effects and gain. I will begin my talk by discussing how time modulation can be used to achieve magnetless nonreciprocity in various frequency ranges, with applications in the design of circulators for full-duplex communication systems, isolators for protection of sources, nonreciprocal metasurfaces for advanced wave manipulation, and topological insulators that are immune to disorder. Next, I will show how by combining electromagnetic resonances with nonlinear effects, it is possible to design interesting optical functionalities, such as isolators without any form of biasing, and power limiters. I will also present the unique characteristics of structures with balanced gain and loss, focusing on the unprecedented functionalities that such structures can provide, including broadband cloaking and negative refraction without using resonant metamaterials. I will show how all these concepts are aligned with the recent advances in the fabrication of efficient nanodevices at microwave, THz and optical frequencies, and provide a general vision for a new generation of electromagnetic devices.

Ultra-wideband Millimeter-wave Integrated Circuits for 5G Communications and Beyond

</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
The demand for wireless capacity and data rates continues to grow unabated. In order to meet this demand, future communication systems will incorporate a mix of new techniques at all layers of the network. At the physical layer, these include reconfigurable spectrum sharing radios in the low GHz bands, and (sub)mm-wave radios. In both types of systems, the need to support very wide bandwidths and massively large numbers of antennas in an energy efficient manner is of paramount importance. In this talk, I will describe our recent research aimed at addressing these challenges. In particular, we will describe design techniques for energy efficient beamformers, digital frequency synthesizers and mixed-signal interfaces for such systems. I will also briefly describe recent developments in CMU’s long standing research on the reconfiguration of RF integrated circuits using phase-change switches, which we envision as a “more-than-Moore” element that can augment the capabilities of standard CMOS technologies.

From Low power to Predictive Analytics for VLSI - Beyond Guessing
</span>
<br><br><b>
Abstract:
</b><br>
Moore’s law drives lowering cost/function ratio and thus pushes addition of more functions on a chip. This requires reduction in power. In Internet of Everything (IoE), System on Chip (SOC), flexible electronics, 3D printing the drive towards low power while maintaining functionality will be essential. Also power has become the key driving force in high performance processor designs as the frequency scale-up is reaching saturation. In order to achieve low power system, circuit and technology co-design is essential. This talk focuses on pros and cons analysis of technology and circuit techniques from power perspective and various techniques to exploit lower power. The talk highlights fundamentals and the direction for low power optimization such as reduction in active, leakage, short circuit power and collision power will continue to be the focal area for in the scaled world. Conventional and advanced techniques (e.g. clock gating, power gating, longer channel, multi-Vt design, stacking, header-footer device techniques and new developments etc.) will be described for logic and memories. Finally key challenges in achieving low power will be described.
<br>
As the technology pushes towards sub-14nm era, process variability and geometric variation in devices can cause variation in power, performance and functionality. Predictive Analytics to capture systematic and random variation and to aid in robust design optimization in nm regime will be discussed. Also the talk will describe future growth directions and role of such predictive algorithms.
