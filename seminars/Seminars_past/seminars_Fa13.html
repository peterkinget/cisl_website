A Model-Agnostic Technique for Simulating Per-Element Distortion Contributions
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The nonlinearity of an element can be altered while retaining the original operating point and first-order terms by appropriately combining multiple instances of the nonlinear element with appropriate scaling factors for incremental voltages above the operating points. Per-element distortion contributions in a circuit can then be determined by altering the nonlinear terms by known factors and simulating the output distortion in each case. This technique can be used in a standard circuit simulator with the appropriate nonlinear device models but requires no knowledge of the device model details on the part of the circuit designer. The technique is demonstrated by applying it to a common source amplifier with a nonlinear load and a two stage fully differential opamp.<br><br>

A Fully-Integrated Dual-Polarization 16-Element W-band Phased-Array Transceiver in SiGe BiCMOS
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
This talk presents the design and measurement of a SiGe BiCMOS W-band (~94 GHz) phased-array transceiver IC with an in-package antenna array. The design targets radar and active imaging applications where light weight and low volume are important considerations; it also supports communication. By tiling an appropriate number of packaged ICs on a circuit board, any arbitrary antenna aperture can be realized, while maintaining ~λ/2 antenna element spacing. The IC integrates 32 receive elements and 16 transmit elements to support 16 dual polarized antennas in a package. It is fabricated in the IBM SiGe BiCMOS8HP 0.13um process, occupies an area of 6.6X6.7mm2, and operates from 2.7V (analog/RF) and 1.5V (digital) supplies. Measurement results show 8dB receiver NF and 2dBm transmitter output power per element at 94GHz in both polarizations.<br><br>

Fully Integrated Phase Noise Extraction and Cancellation Technique for Ring-Oscillator Based Fractional-N PLLs
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Ring-oscillators (ROs) provide a low-cost digital VCO solution in fully integrated PLLs. However due to their supply noise sensitivity and high noise floor, their applications have been limited to low performance applications. The proposed architecture introduces an analog feed-forward adaptive phase noise cancellation architecture that extracts and suppresses phase noise of ring-oscillators outside the PLL bandwidth. The proposed technique can improve the phase noise at an arbitrary offset frequency and bandwidth, and after initial calibration for gain it is insensitive to process, voltage and temperature variations. An experimental fractional PLL, with a loop bandwidth of 200 kHz is utilized to demonstrate the active phase noise cancellation approach. The cancellation loop is designed to suppress the phase noise at 1 MHz offset by 12.5 dB and reference spur by 13 dB with less than 17% increase in the overall power consumption at 5.1 GHz frequency. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset after cancellation is -105 dBc/Hz. The proposed RO-PLL is fabricated in 90nm CMOS process. With noise cancellation loop enabled, the PLL consumes 24.7 mA at 1.2V supply.<br><br>

Circuits and Architectures for Broadband Channelizers
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Decomposing a broadband signal  into multiple channels  in the analog domain, for analysis,  offers several potentially power-saving features compared to full-spectrum digitization, including the ability to selectively amplify, reject or digitize portions of the signal spectrum. In this talk we will describe circuits and architectures for broadband channelizers that perform analog-domain spectrum decomposition. Such channelizers can find application in cognitive radios, software-defined radios, spectrum analyzers and frequency-domain analog-to-digital converters. Key challenges and considerations in the design of such channelizers relating to LO synthesis, spurious performance and dynamic range will be addressed. Two architectures  for broadband channelization will be described. The design of high performance harmonic rejection mixers employed in one of the approaches will be discussed. An architecture for feedback-based linearization of a channelizer will be presented. The talk will also provide a brief overview of other on-going work in our lab in the area of RF and high-speed analog circuit design.<br><br>

Reconfigurable Radio-Frequency Transceivers (Distinguished Lecture Co-sponsored by IEEE NY EDS/SSCS) 
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Modern commercial and military wireless systems should support various waveforms and standards under dynamically changing electromagnetic environments.  A straight forward Software-Defined Radio (SDR) enables changing the radio parameters, such as carrier frequency, modulation format, and signal bandwidth, in a fixed architecture, through software. A more advanced reconfigurable radio enables changing the architecture of the transceiver and/or the individual building blocks in order to optimize the performance while minimizing the power consumption. Architectural level reconfigurability reduce the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) cost associated with the design of a new transceiver tailored to a specific application. Moreover, dynamic adjustment of radio architecture and specifications can be in response to, for instance, varying signal to noise ratio levels, locations and powers of interference and jamming signals, etc. This talk covers several examples of reconfigurable radio-frequency transceivers implemented in CMOS technology.<br><br>

Characterization of BTI induced variability in scaled Metal Gate / High-K CMOS technologies
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Time-zero and time dependent variability is a growing concern for aggressively scaled transistor technologies with metal gate/high-k stacks. Bias temperature instability (BTI) in PMOS as well as NMOS devices is considered the most dominant time dependent variability component and needs to be modeled using stochastic processes. The physical nature of the stochastic process is still under debate and to support the model development efforts large statistical data sets are essential. In this presentation, we will focus on the characterization challenges related to stochastic BTI process in small area CMOS devices and discuss the large scale data we collected on discrete SRAM and logic devices. Finally we will elaborate on the impact of BTI induced variability on End-of-Life threshold voltage distributions and show that BTI induced variability is not the major contributing factor in the post stress threshold voltage variability in planar metal gate/high-k CMOS devices.<br><br>

Parametric Excitation
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A time-varying capacitor embedded in suitable supporting circuitry
can be made to exhibit a negative resistance -- hence, can provide
gain, sustain an oscillation or convert energy from one frequency
to another -- all theoretically noise-free and with 100% efficiency
(because it is a lossless circuit element).Of course, there are some details and parasitic resistances degrade
the efficiency.
<br>
In this talk, I will survey some of the early history of such
parametric circuits, then show some modern circuit implementations
with possible applications to RFID tags or (very ambitious) a possible
replacement for the traveling-wave tube.

					<b>Biography:</b><br>
Bob Melville did his undergraduate training at the University of Delaware,
then went on to graduate work at Cornell, culminating in a Ph. D. in Computer
Science in 1981. He was a junior faculty member at Johns Hopkins University
before joining Bell Labs in 1985. He worked at the labs for 16 years in the
areas of computer-aided design, numerical simulation of electronic circuits,
and design an fabrication of RF integrated circuits. Most recently, he has taught
electrical engineering at Columbia University and served with
the United States Antarctic Program at the Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole
doing engineering work in support of geophysics experiments.
<br>
Dr. Melville is a member of the IEEE, has served as a professional referee for
various IEEE-sponsored journals and conferences, and the Society for Industrial
and Applied Mathematics. He co-organized a conference on numerical circuit simulation
at Sandia National Labs and participated in the AT&T "Teachers and Technology" enrichment
program for high-school math and science teachers. He is also extra-class amateur
radio operator wb3eft.
