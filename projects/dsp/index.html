It is widely recognized that adaptive control of the power supply is one of the 
most effective variables to achieve energy-efficient computiton.&nbsp; In this 
work, we describe the development of a high-performance asynchronous 
micropipelined datapath that provides robust interfaces across voltage domains, 
performing appropriate voltage level conversions and operating between stages 
with fanout-of-four delays differing by almost two orders of magnitude.&nbsp; 
With software-specified throughput requirements, the power supply of the 
datapath is scaled from 2.5 V to 650 mV using an on-chip dc-dc conversion system 
that combines linear regulators and switched-capacitor power supplies.&nbsp; 
Because of the asynchronous design style, the processor operates continuously 
during the voltage scaling transitions.</p>
