Description:
</h2>
<p>
In digital integrated circuits, analog voltages are used to define logic '0' and '1'. 
In particular, in CMOS design, a node at the supply voltage is traditionally regarded as representing a 
logic '1' while a node at ground is a logic '0'.
The logic abstraction has largey dominated the tools and techniques of digital design.
Because of technology scaling and every more aggressive clock frequencies, "analog" effects which 
challenge these simplifications must be considered in digital design to an extent never before
required.  
</p>
<p>
In this research, we have developed a technique known as "static noise analysis"
which allows chip-wide verification of signal integrity in digital integrated circuits.
This research has been commercialized in the PacifIC and CeltIC products from

<p>
As technology scales into the deep submicron regime, noise immunity is becoming a 
metric of comparable importance to area, timing, and power for the analysis and design
of very large scale (VLSI) systems.
A metric for noise immunity is define, and a static noise analysis methodology based on this noise-stability
metric is introduced to demonstrate how noise can be analyzed systematically on a full-chip basis
using simulation-based transistor-level analysis.
We then describe Harmony, a two-level (macro and global) hierarchical implementation 
of static noise analysis.
At the macro level, simplified interconnect models and timing assumptions guide efficient
analysis.
The global level involves a careful combination of static noise analysis, static timine analysis,
and detailed interconnect macromodels based on reduced-order modeling techniques.
We describe how the interconnect macromodels are practially employed to perform 
coupling analysis and how timing constraints can be used to limit pessimism in the 
analysis.

<p>
Verifying whether a digital standard-cell design is functional in the presence
of interconnect coupling noise is an important concern to ASIC designers.
Determingin whether the coupling noise occuring on a node is excessive
requires comparing this noise against the dynamic noise margins of the receiving
gates.
The noise stability requirement, introduced in the context of transistor-lvel
static noise analysis, is a technique for quantifying these ac noise margins.
In this paper, we describe a technique for modelling noise stability
in the form of a five-parameter rule which can be used to characterize the cells
of a digital standard-cell library.

<p>
As feature sized descrease and clock frequencies increase, noise is becoming a greater
concern in digital IC design.
The authors describe a verification metric, noise stability, which guarantees functionality
in the presence of noise, and a CAD technique, static noise analysis, for 
applying this metric on a chipwide basis.
