<p>
We have recently begun work in the area of mixed-signal test with the 
development of on-chip sampling oscilloscopes.

<p>
High-speed digital design is becoming increasingly analog.
In particular, interconnect response at high frequencies can be 
nonmonotonic with "porch steps" and ringing.
Crosstalk (both capacitive and inductive) can result in glitches on wires that
can produce functional failures in receiving circuits.
Most of these important effect are not addressed with traditional ARPG and BIST
techniques, which are limited to the binary abstraction.
In this work, we explote the feasibility of integrating promitive sampling
oscilloscopes on-chip to provide waveforms on selective critical nets
for test and diagnosis.
The oscilloscopes rely on subsampling techniques to achieve sub-10psec timing 
accuracy.
High speed samplers are combined with DLLs and 
a simple 8-bit ADC to convert the 
waveforms into digital data than can be invorporated as part of the chip scan
chain.
We will describe the design and measurement of a chip we have fabricated to 
incorporate these oscilloscopes with a high-frequency interconnect structure
iin a TSMC 0.25 um process.
