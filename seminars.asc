Abstract
Phase lock loops (PLLs) are an indispensable part of todayâ€™s
systems-on-chip (SOCs). They are used extensively for generating clocks
for digital signal processing blocks, as well as carriers for RF
receive/transmit blocks. Traditional implementations of PLLs have been
analog in nature. With the trend towards system integration using
digital CMOS technologies, a new class of PLLs, namely, Digital Phase
Lock Loops (DPLLs) has emerged recently. DPLLs  offer several
advantages, including the elimination of passive components, flexibility
and programmability and the possibility of applying sophisticated DSP
techniques to improve performance and reduce power consumption. This
talk will present an overview of recent developments in DPLL
architectures and circuits.

Dr. Ulrich L.  Rohde
Chairman
Synergy Microwave Corporation

Date:  September 11th, 14:00, 414 CESPR/Schapiro
Topic:  Modern Ultra-Low-Noise Microwave Transistor Oscillator Design


Abstract

This seminar will cover the design of microwave oscillators based on
bipolar transistors, a topic that has always been considered a   black
art. We will give a thorough presentation of their design. We will look
at both the frequency and time domain approaches, and  use  nonlinear
S-parameters to determine the starting and  sustaining  conditions. 
These determine the phase noise.  It is possible to  use this technique
for MOS transistors and also planar  multiple  resonators; the use of
"tricky" circuits will further  improve the  phase noise.  The technique
presented may also be  applicable for IC  designs.
