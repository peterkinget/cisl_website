<p><li> Four different papers involve CISL members at the upcoming ISSCC 2010. They are: <br>
"An Ultra-Low-Power Interference-Robust IR-UWB Transceiver Chipset Using Self-Synchronizing OOK Modulation", <br>"A Low-power Low-noise Direct-Conversion Front End with Digitally Assisted IIP2 Background 
Self Calibration", <br>"A 4-Channel, 4-Beam, 24-26GHz, Spatio-Temporal RAKE Radar Transceiver in 90nm CMOS for Vehicular Radar Applications",  <br>
"A 3.5GHz Wideband ADPLL with Fractional Spur Suppression Through TDC Dithering and Feedforward Compensation". 
<br>
The first two report on 
work done at CISL; the first paper is by Marco Crepaldi, Chen Li, Keith Dronson, Jorge Fernandes and Prof. Peter Kinget with the second 
paper being co-authored by Yiping Feng and Prof. Peter Kinget and collaborators from Toshiba. The third paper reports on work performed 
by a CISL member, Prof. Harish Krishnaswamy, primarily at the University of Southern California. The last paper involves the participation of a CISL member, Colin Weltin-Wu, in work primarily done at the University of Pavia, Italy in collaboration with ST Microelectronics. Also at ISSCC 2010, Prof. Peter Kinget will be co-teaching in the short course, "CMOS Phase-locked Loops for Frequency Synthesis", and Prof. Yannis Tsividis will be on an Evening Panel, "Stump the Panel".


<p><li> Frank Zhang received the <a href = "http://www.ee.columbia.edu/pages/awards/index.html">2009 Jury Award</a> from the Electrical  
Engineering Department for his Ph.D. thesis "Ultra Wideband Pulse  
Radio Receivers in Digital CMOS". The Jury Award was established in  
1991 for outstanding achievement by a graduate student in the areas of  
system communication or signal processing.

<p><li>Congratulations to EE faculty member, Prof. Harish Krishnaswamy, who has just won the <b>Best Thesis in Experimental Research</b> across the entire Viterbi School of Engineering at USC for the 2008-09 academic year
