<center><h2>Student Projects Laboratory</h2></center>

<p>
The Department of Electrical Engineering invites you to use
the EE Student Projects Laboratory
at 1212 S.W. Mudd Building
<p>

This is an "open doors" laboratory. This essentially means that you can walk
in and work on whatever project you would like, as long as the laboratory
doors
are open.
<p>
<h2>More About the Lab</h2>
<p>
The laboratory is equipped with electronic test and measurement equipment,
discrete components, breadboards and soldering stations. If you have
any projects in mind, you can build and test it over here. There will be
project ideas made available to you through the lab TA from time to time.
If you are new to electronics and are keen on learning more, this is a
quick way to pick up skills! If you are even peripherally interested, just
come in, talk to us, and tinker with the tools and equipment.

<h2><a href="safety.html">Safety in the Laboratory</a></h2>
<p>
To ensure a safe laboratory a list of rules and fundamental safety principles 
has been developed and provided for you <a href="safety.html">here</a>. These rules must be followed at all times. This, in the form of a contract, is
available <a href="Safety.doc">here</a>. Please print this out, sign it, and
keep a copy for yourself. The signed copy should be handed over to John Kazana.

<h2>Good Lab Practices</h2>
Hints for good lab practices, breadboarding, debugging, running
experiments, ground connections etc. can be found in the book by Y.
Tsividis, "A First Lab in Circuits and Electronics", Wiley, New York, 2002.
