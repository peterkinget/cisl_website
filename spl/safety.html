<h2>Laboratory Rules and Regulations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Cleanup</b> the bench <b>before</b> you leave. 
<li>Nothing other than the instruments should be left on 
your table after you leave. 
<li><b>Switch OFF</b> all instruments before you leave. 
<li><b>Return cables</b> back to the marked cable racks. 
<li>Swipe access to the lab will be revoked if you are found to be untidy.
</ul>

<h2>Safety in the Student Projects Laboratory</h2>
<p>

To ensure a safe laboratory a list of rules and fundamental safety 
principles has been developed and provided to you in this page. 
These rules must be followed at all times. You will find this document as
a contract <a href="Safety.doc">here</a>. Please print this out, sign this,
and keep a copy for yourself. The signed copy should be handed over to John
Kazana. 
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Conduct yourself in a responsible manner at all times.  Never work in 
the lab alone.
<li>
Practice proper housekeeping and cleanliness. Poor housekeeping is a 
major factor in many accidents. A cluttered area is likely to be unsafe 
and inefficient.
	<ul>
	<li>Do not leave lose parts including wires on your bench. Leave your 
project in a cabinet. 
	<li>Do not place drinks or food on your bench.
	</ul>

<li>Identify hazards and anticipate problems.
<p>
 Many electrical hazards can be easily identified before a serious problem 
exists. Common indications of electrical problems include 
flickering lights, warm switches or receptacles, burning odors, lose 
connections, frayed, cracked or broken wires. Inspect all cords, plugs and 
equipment for possible damage and notify your instructor if you see any 
such damage. Also notify your instructor if you see any other sign of 
trouble such as loose wall sockets or sparks.

<p>
<b>In case of POWER FAILURE
Call x4-4899 ( Area  D ) or call EH&RS, x4-8749<br>
STOP WORKING !
</b>

<ul>
<li>Be aware of the fact that electronic components can overheat. Do not 
exceed the voltage and/or power rating of electronic components.
<li><b>Be very careful to observe the polarity of electrolytic capacitors,
which can explode if connected the wrong way.</b>
<li>While making circuit connections turn off all power first and 
unplug the equipment. Even then be aware that capacitors can store 
electric charges and give you an electric shock, especially if their 
capacitance is large and they are charged to a large voltage. Inductors 
have the ability to release stored energy at a much higher voltage than that 
used to pass a current through them. 
An arc is often created when a short circuit occurs or 
current flow is interrupted. If the current involved is strong enough, 
these arcs can cause injury or start a fire. Fires can also be started by 
overheated equipment,overheated electronic components or by conductors 
that carry too much current.
<li>Notify your instructor if you receive an electric shock, however small. 
<li>If somebody else in the lab receives an electric shock, immediately turn 
off the power and/or remove the victim from the source of electricity 
WITHOUT coming into electrical contact yourself ( e.g., use a dry piece of 
wood, a dry piece of cloth, or a nonmetallic belt).
</ul>
<p>
<b>MEDICAL EMERGENCY:</b>
<ul>
<li>
For minor injuries go to HEALTH SERVICES on the 3rd floor of John Jay 
Hall (114th ST. &amp; Amsterdam Ave, southeast corner of campus). For more 
serious medical emergencies (unconsciousness, chest pain, breathing 
stops, deep cuts requiring stitches, etc.)  CALL SECURITY at x99 DO NOT 
call 911!
<li>
Do not work when your skin is wet. Wear shoes while working, and be sure 
they are dry. 
<li>Do not wear metallic objects such as bracelets, necklaces, 
rings, or chains while working. 
<li>Be careful with soldering irons; they 
can cause burns or fires. Obtain training in soldering from an instructor.
<li>Do not ignore electrical problems. Think through what might go wrong.
Do not hesitate to discuss any situation or 
question with your instructor, teaching assistant and colleagues.
</ul>

<li>
Resist “hurry-up” pressure. Program pressures should not cause you to 
bypass thoughtful consideration and planned procedures.

<li>
Design for safety. Consider safety to be an integral part of the design process.

<li>Have designs reviewed by an instructor and/or a TA.

<li>Have designs and operation verified.

<li>Use electrical devices only as intended. Electrical devices may not be 
modified beyond the intent of their design. Electrical equipment is only 
safe when it is used according to its intended purpose. Some examples of 
misuse of electrical equipment are: 
	<ul>
	<li>Pulling out a plug by the cord 
rather than by the plug. 
	<li>Inserting wires or objects other than a standard plug into a receptacle outlet. 
	<li>Deforming a contact to enable it 
to fit a receptacle for which it was not intended.
	</ul>

<li>Reset circuit breakers only after the problem has been corrected.

</ol>
