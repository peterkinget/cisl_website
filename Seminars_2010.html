					Addressing the Thermal and Power Challenges of Tera-Scale Computing
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b>
Power and temperature are major physical challenges that need to be addressed in current and future computing systems.
In this talk three synergistic techniques will be presented to address these challenges, including:
<br>(1) Thermal characterization techniques to identify the locations of temperature hot spots in real processors, and to use these locations to drive an optimal thermal sensor allocation technique.
<br>(2) Dynamic thermal management techniques for multi-core processors where the performance of a real processor is optimally adapted depending on thermal slack measured by the thermal sensors during runtime.
<br>(3) Post-silicon power modeling techniques where accurate spatial power estimates for various circuit blocks are computed using the measured thermal infrared emissions from the backside of the die.
In addition, the experimental techniques required for infrared imaging and power acquisition of real systems will be overviewed. Our current research on devising improved energy-proportional computing systems for data centers will be also overviewed.

						Robustness and Resiliency of Data Conversion
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b> As the performance and cost-per-function continue to excel for microelectronic devices,
					the underlying economic driving force is rapidly adapting the fabrication technology to meet the critical
					needs of the industry. Our past research has shown that with the leverage of system-level and digital techniques,
					energy efficiency can be continually accelerated for data conversion circuits in scaled technology nodes.
					While the approach is making significant progresses in marching the benchmark of CMOS ADC figure-of-merit (FoM),
					a paradigm-shifting challenge has emerged in the nano-scale regime and beyond: analog robustness and resiliency,
					in the headwind of exponentially growing process/device variability and degrading operation environment due to mixed-signal
					integration. In this talk, I will identify a few architectural and circuit techniques to cope with the new challenges
					in the data conversion area. The focus will be placed on redundant analog architectures and judicious application of digital
					techniques for error correction. Some prototype results will be showcased during the talk.

						All-Digital RF Circuits Synthesized from Digital Standard Cell Libraries
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b> RF front-end circuits designed today for operation in the 1 to 10GHz range are almost exclusively fabricated in CMOS processes. This includes low-noise and power amplifiers, mixers, oscillators, A/D converters... all the components that allow radios to communicate wirelessly. Traditional design of these RF components relies on precise RF models, high-quality passives, and time-consuming custom layout for matching and controlled parasitics. The basic building blocks used to realize these RF components are, not surprisingly: transistors, resistors, inductors, and capacitors. CMOS logic has become so fast, it is now realistic to design logic using full-swing CMOS standard cell libraries that switch a >10GHz speeds. CMOS logic has become so small, we can now fit 1000's of gates in the area occupied by 1 inductor. As RF circuit designers, we can think about how to accomplish the same functionality of an RF front-end, but do so with a new set of basic building blocks: NAND, tri-state buffers, flip-flops, etc. This could allow us to describe RF circuits as a netlist of only logic gates, which in-turn enables fully automated layout with digital CAD tools. Benefits include reduced chip area, which will continue to shrink with process scaling. With smaller area also comes lower power. This talk will present several implementations of all-digital RF circuits synthesized from digital standard cell libraries. A UWB transmitter, time-to-digital converter, and PLL in 65nm CMOS will be presented, as well as an FM radio in an FPGA. The core tuning structures and the calibration technique will be described, which allows the circuits to be precisely regulated over process, voltage, and temperature variations.
