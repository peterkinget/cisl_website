                    The journey to high speed and high resolution SAR ADCs -- an engineering case study

                <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                Analog-to-digital converters are ubiquitous in today's information era, from cell phones, cameras, to cars and industrial equipment. Successive approximation registers (SAR) ADCs are unique among various types of ADCs in that they are power efficient, small and have very low latency. On the other hand, SAR ADCs are inherently slower than some other types of ADCs, like pipeline and flash, due to its sequential bit-trial nature for each conversion. As such, SAR ADCs mainly find applications in lower than 10Msps space. This talk will be divided into two sections. In the first section, an 80Msps, 14-bit SAR ADC will be presented, with highlights of several ideas which enabled the high speed and high resolution operation. In the second section, the design will be used as an engineering case study to show the technical journey of pushing the state-of-the-art of SAR ADCs.

                      Radiation sensors detect and convert radiation of interest (e.g. charged particles, neutrons, X- and gamma-rays) into electric charge. Reading out from radiation sensors requires highly specialized electronics. In this talk, the low-noise design techniques and circuits adopted in state-of-the-art CMOS ICs for radiation detectors are presented. Examples in space, physics, and medical applications are given, explaining some special issues on CMOS devices including lifetime and radiation-induced leakage.

                    Continuous-time Delta Sigma Data Converters with Reduced Clock Jitter Sensitivity and Enhanced Linearity (Co-sponsored by IEEE NY EDS/SSCS)

                <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                Clock jitter degrades the performance of a continuous-time delta sigma converter. A common approach to addressing this issue is the use of a switched capacitor feedback DAC. Unfortunately, using such a DAC can severely degrade the modulator's linearity. In this talk, I will describe the Switched-Capacitor Return-to-Zero DAC, which is a recent technique that improves jitter immunity and modulator linearity at the same time.
                A modulator test chip designed and fabricated in a 0.18um CMOS process achieves 87dB dynamic range in a 2MHz bandwidth.

                <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                Independent of who is telling the story, DSP is a relatively new concept.  For example, at Texas Instruments, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the programmable DSP this year.  But that birth 30 years ago was the result of many discoveries made in academic research labs.  But, in this talk, we will only focus on that part of the DSP story in which we played a prominent role.  We will start the story with our first programmable DSP, the TMS32010 and tell the story of how DSP moved from being magic to being an permanent part of our lives.  We will finish the talk with a few predictions of what the future might hold for these amazing processors which take the theories of signal processing and make their magic much more than an allusion.

                <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                Phase noise in CMOS LC VCOs is fundamentally limited by the oscillation amplitude and the inherent device noise. This talk will describe a new approach based on transconductance linearization of the active devices that increases the signal swing while reducing the active device noise contribution in LC VCOs providing excellent phase noise performance.
                
                A prototype 25GHz VCO based on this linearization approach is integrated in a dual-path PLL and achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art. The design is implemented in 32nm SOI CMOS technology and achieves a phase noise of −130dBc/Hz at a 10MHz offset from a 22GHz carrier. A new layout approach for switched capacitor arrays enables a wide tuning range of 23%.
                
                Also, a digitally assisted autonomic biasing technique is implemented in the PLL to provide a phase noise and power optimized VCO bias across frequency and process. Measurement results to indicate the efficacy of the autonomic biasing scheme will be presented.

                      Increasing demand for portable electronics results without increasing battery capability results in an ever increasing demand for increased computational resources in a constant power environment. We effectively want to utilize the physics of computing systems more efficiently; the question is how to engineer such systems. These techniques are even more critical given the saturation of computational energy efficiency of digital multiply accumulate structures, the key component for high-performance computing. One approach would be to consider using analog techniques. These approaches are fueled by recent advances in programmable and configurable large-scale analog circuits and systems enabling a typical factor of 1000 improvement in computational power (Energy) efficiency over their digital counterparts. Large-Scale Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA), devices analogous to FPGAs, enable configurable analog approaches. The ability for non-volatile analog memory fuels all other innovations. We will overview a few examples in this area including speech, vision, and sensor interfaces, as well as the CAD tools to enable design of these systems. Another approach is to take inspiration from neurobiological systems to further improve the resulting energy efficiency. These silicon systems mimic extremely energy efficient neural computing structures, potentially both for solving engineering applications as well as understanding neural computation. These neuromorphic systems should enable additional increases in energy efficiency; recent research has demonstrated some of these examples. Scaling of energy efficiency, performance, and size impact the application space of Neuromorphic systems. Therefore, research in analog signal processing, neuromorphic engineering, and programmable / configurable analog approaches provide opportunities for continued energy efficiency scaling.

                      Flexibility and reconfigurability are the new keywords in RF design, several applications require transceivers operating in different modes to fulfill market requirements. Recent research has shown two very different trends.  Classical analog-inspired architectures focus on performance numbers that are on par with dedicated radios, using circuits and techniques that offer programmability at low (or no) cost. Digital-intensive approaches offer flexibility for free, but even more important are not limited by the analog performance bottlenecks in new technology nodes.
                      This presentation will give an overview of several examples in this field, with a focus on their respective possibilities and limitations. The analog voltage-sampling transmitter is a key enabler for the tough out-of-band noise requirements in cellular systems. Extension with harmonic-rejection techniques allow is also the tackle the linearity counter-IM3 issue in LTE systems.  On the digital side, both polar and cartesian (I/Q) direct digital RF modulators (DDRM) are published, that take the functionality of an RF DAC. FIR-based filtering is proposed to lower RX-band noise below the quantization noise, and a Doherty architecture tackles the efficiency for high output powers.

Parametric Excitation
					
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A time-varying capacitor embedded in suitable supporting circuitry
can be made to exhibit a negative resistance -- hence, can provide
gain, sustain an oscillation or convert energy from one frequency
to another -- all theoretically noise-free and with 100% efficiency
(because it is a lossless circuit element).Of course, there are some details and parasitic resistances degrade
the efficiency.
<br>
In this talk, I will survey some of the early history of such
parametric circuits, then show some modern circuit implementations
with possible applications to RFID tags or (very ambitious) a possible
replacement for the traveling-wave tube.
					<br><br>

					<b>Biography:</b><br>
Bob Melville did his undergraduate training at the University of Delaware,
then went on to graduate work at Cornell, culminating in a Ph. D. in Computer
Science in 1981. He was a junior faculty member at Johns Hopkins University
before joining Bell Labs in 1985. He worked at the labs for 16 years in the
areas of computer-aided design, numerical simulation of electronic circuits,
and design an fabrication of RF integrated circuits. Most recently, he has taught
electrical engineering at Columbia University and served with
the United States Antarctic Program at the Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole
doing engineering work in support of geophysics experiments.
<br>
Dr. Melville is a member of the IEEE, has served as a professional referee for
various IEEE-sponsored journals and conferences, and the Society for Industrial
and Applied Mathematics. He co-organized a conference on numerical circuit simulation
at Sandia National Labs and participated in the AT&T "Teachers and Technology" enrichment
program for high-school math and science teachers. He is also extra-class amateur
radio operator wb3eft.
