# This is a sample parameters file
# blank lines and lines that start with a '#' are ignored

# The first few lines specify the deviation and shift
# for capacitors, resistors, and inductors

# the format of the line is:
# "device <deviation> <shift>"

capacitor   0.01  -0.10  #this sets capacitor deviation to 1% and shift to 10%
resistor   -0.10   0.10	 #both values are in decimals and not percents
inductor    0.05    0.01


# save lines indicate what voltage node or current node to save
# the format of save lines is:
# 'save <node1>'

#save net13
#save net17
save V0:n
save V2:n
#save I1:1


# all other lines are treated as MOSFET parameter lines
# file format is:
# "modelname param1=<value1> param2=<value2> ... paramn=<valuen>'
# parameters can be passed in any order

# delvt = V
# db_b = %
# avt = V*m
# Ab = %*m
# m = unitless

# if no values exist, it is assumed that standard deviations of Vt and u are zero
# thus, they will be zero as their means are zero.
