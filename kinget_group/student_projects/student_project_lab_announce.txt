     Feb. 13 at 1:30 PM in front of 1212 Mudd

Dear Electrical and Computer Engineering Students:

I am writing with some good news.

Please join us on Friday, Feb. 13 at 1:30 PM in front of 1212 Mudd for the
opening of our new EE Student Projects Lab.  To celebrate the occasion, we
will have lunch for all!

Many of you had expressed an interest in having available a lab with
electronic test equipment and tools for you to pursue projects of your own
devising. We have been working to meet this demand.

We are now proud to announce and open our new EE Student Projects Lab in
1212 Mudd.  The lab contains seven work stations equipped with a variety
of electronic instrumentation. We anticipate future improvements based on
student interest and demand.  Please come and take a look.

The lab will be available to you, subject to demand by other students, on
a regular basis during these hours:

         Mon-Fri: 9 am - Noon and 2 pm to 4 pm
         Mon, Wed, & Fri: 7 pm  9 pm
         Sun: 2 pm - 6 pm

Students at all levels are welcome. The lab will be supervised by our
Manager of Undergraduate Labs, Mr. John Kazana.  Mr.  Kazana is located at
xxxx ; ext. xxx; email: xxx@columbia.edu

We hope that all of you will drop by to see the lab this Friday -- and,
more importantly, will put it to good use in the future!

Chair, Department of Electrical Engineering
