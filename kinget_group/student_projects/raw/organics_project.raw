<p><i>Interested in working on a challenging project exploring novel
organic devices and their circuit applications?

<center><h1>Design of Organics Interface Circuits</h1></center>

<p>Our research group has an extensive background in the design of
analog and RF integrated circuit using silicon devices. We want to
explore the design of analog interface circuits using organic
transistors to be co-integrated with organic displays, photodetectors or
other sensor devices.

<p>We are looking for highly motivated students interested in doing a
research project including: 

<UL> 

<LI>integrated circuit design,</li>

<LI>interface architectural exploration,</li>

<LI>device characterization and modeling,</li>

</UL>


<P> These projects give you a unique opportunity of doing a integrated
system and circuit design, and the goal is to go from circuit idea to
simulation and layout, through fabrication and experimental
characterization (the whole cycle requires 2 semesters). 
</P>

<P> This project is in collaboration with Prof. Kymissis' group. </p>

<I>Intrigued? Interested?</I>

<P>Contact: <a

<p>Open for <I>qualified</I> B.S, M.S. or Ph.D students; 1 or group of 2
students</P>

<p>This project can be done for credit.</P>
