<p><i>Interested in working on a challenging project with state-of-the-art
design tools, characterization equipment and devices fabricated in
modern integrated circuit process technology?</i>

<center><h1>Device Variations Characterization in Advanced IC Processes</h1></center>

<p>Our research group has an extensive background in device mismatch
modeling and its effects on analog circuit performance. We are currently
engaged in the design of <u>novel process test modules for the
characterization of device variability for a number of basic analog and
digital circuit cells</u>. We are further developing automated test-setups
for the device characterization and model extraction.

<p>We are looking for highly motivated students interested in doing a
research project including: 

<UL> 

<LI>integrated circuit design,</li>

<LI>device characterization and modeling,</li>

<LI>automated device measurements.</li>

</UL>


<P> These projects give you a unique opportunity of doing a integrated
circuit design, advanced circuit measurements and device
characterization and modeling.  </P>


<I>Intrigued? Interested?</I>
