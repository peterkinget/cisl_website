<p><i>Interested in working on a challenging project with
state-of-the-art design tools, characterization equipment and devices
fabricated in advanced integrated circuit process technology?</i>

<center><h1> Wireless Testing of Integrated Circuits </h1></center>

<p>We have developed a methodology for the wireless test of integrated
circuits. Such methodology will result in very significant cost
reductions in the test and debugging of advanced integrated circuits.

<p>We are looking for highly motivated students interested in doing a
research project on: 

<UL> 

<LI>device testing,</li>

<LI>integrated circuit design,</li>

<LI>wireless and RF design.</li>

</UL>


<P> This project gives you a unique opportunity of learning about
advanced issues in device testing and debugging, RF and wireless design
and integrated circuit design. The goal is to work out a testing method
and its circuit implemenation, to do circuit simulations and layout,
fabrication and experimental characterization (the whole cycle requires
2 semesters).

<p>Open for <I>qualified</I> B.S, M.S. or Ph.D students; 1 or group of 2
students</P>

<p>This project can be done for credit.</P>
