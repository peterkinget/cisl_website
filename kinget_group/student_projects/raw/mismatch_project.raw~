<p><i>Interested in working on a challenging project with state-of-the-art
design tools, characterization equipment and devices fabricated in
modern integrated circuit process technology?</i>

<center><h1> Ultra-low voltage analog circuit design  </h1></center>

<p>Our research group has been pushing the state-of-the-art in low
voltage analog CMOS integrated circuits. We have currently demonstrated
'record breaking' complex analog integrated circuits operating from a
supply voltage as low as 0.45 V!

<p>We are looking for highly motivated students interested in doing a
research project on low voltage analog integrated circuit design.
Specific topics include:

<UL> 

<LI>MOS device characterization and modeling,</li>

<LI>operational amplifier design,</li>

<LI>continuous time active filter design,</li>

<LI>and programmable gain amplifier design.</li>

</UL>


<P> These projects
give you a unique opportunity of doing a complete analog integrated
circuit design. The goal is to go from circuit idea, to simulation
and layout, through fabrication and experimental characterization. 
</P>


<I>Intrigued? Interested?</I>

<p>Open for <I>qualified</I> B.S, M.S. or Ph.D students; 1 or group of 2
students</P>

<p>This project can be done for credit.</P>
