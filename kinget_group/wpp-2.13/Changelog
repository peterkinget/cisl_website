2.13  2000/12/10
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.13
* Replaced the last "chop" calls with safer "chomp". The '\n' within macro
  declared in config files now are kept as in raw and tmpl files. (Martin
  Fischer)
* New built-in macros: EVAL and RANDOM.

2.12  2000/11/08
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.12
* Fixed a bug into the macro declaration parsing block, extra spaces after the
  bracket made impossble a correct parsing of the macro arguments.
  (Martin Fischer)
* Fixed a bug in depend mode, config files dependencies in some circumstances
  were printed before a valid makefile target. (Martin Fischer)

2.11  1999/11/29
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.11
* Fixed a bug in macro argument expansion inside the IF test. (Petr Prazak)
* Fixed a serious bug in nested macro expansion, now the macro arguments prefix
  used internally by wpp is randomized.
* New built-in macros:
    FILE_SIZE, FILE_DATE (Petr Prazak)
    SYSTEM (Bastian Kleineidam)
* Customizable DATE format through the DATE_FORMAT variable. (Petr Prazak)
* Stripped the leading spaces and empty lines from the output file. (Petr
  Prazak)

2.10  1999/05/09
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.10
* Requires perl 5.004.
* Fixed a problem with wpp 2.09 running in some environments that don't set PWD
  (Jiri Rubes).
* Fixed a bug when changing the DEFAULT_RAW_EXTENSION from config files (Jiri
  Rubes).

2.09  1999/03/17
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.09
* New variable OUTPUTSUBDIR. By running wpp on "OUTPUTSUBDIR/ex.raw" the
  output file will be placed into "OUTPUTDIR/OUTPUTSUBDIR/ex.html". 
* The syntax for some switches (-c, -D, -W) is changed a bit because wpp now
  uses Getopt::Long for retrieving command line switches.
* Added POD (plain old documentation) documentation for wpp.
* Man page generated with pod2man.

2.08  1998/09/23
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.08
* The built-in macros: HTML_IMAGE, HTML_IMAGE_SIZEO now returns the value of
  SRC attribute of the IMG tag between \".
* When using the -D switch is now checked if you are trying to modify a
  constant.
* The ending '/', if present, is removed into TMPLDIR, OUTPUTDIR,
  DEFAULT_TMPLDIR and DEFAULT_OUTPUTDIR.

2.07  1998/08/31
PUBLIC RELEASE 2.07
* Removed the doubled '\n' at the of every line when expanding a macro.

2.06  1998/08/30
* In config files you can declare and use macros.
* Now you can do also: @IF VAR=="value"@ and @IF VAR!="value"@.
* If the $Date$ RCS tag is empty the @DATE@ variable now contains the last
  modify time or, if the source is STDIN, the current date.

2.05  1998/08/27
* NEW ADDRESS: http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/1474/wpp/
* Clean up of the dependencies generation code.
* Fixed a bug that didn't print depedencies into the tail template.
* Fixed a bug into dependencies for images: if the size is already cached
  the function image_size returns just before printing depedencies.

2.04  1998/08/25
* New built-in macros: HTML_IMAGE_SIZEO, HTML_IMAGE_WIDTH, HTML_IMAGE_HEIGHT,
  IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, CERN2HTML, NCSA2HTML.
* The image size used by the *IMAGE* macros is cached for avoiding excessive
  and unnecessary I/O.
* If a built-in macro reads data from a file, this file will be included into
  the dependencies list.
* Fixed a problem with the read-only variable TEMPLATE that, into the raw
  files, was expanded with the filename value instead of ''.
* Reorganization of the html manual.
* Other minor changes.

2.03  1998/08/18
* Macro calls into variables assignments and macro arguments are detected and
  expanded.

2.02  1998/07/26
* Added the HTML_IMAGE built-in macro.
* The code for removing empty lines was removed because it can break the layout
  of text putted into <PRE> tags (Colin Turnbull).

2.01  1998/07/13
* PUBLIC RELEASE 2.01
* Fixed a missing inclusion of tail template when reading from STDIN and when
  the input file is specified using a directory prefix (Bastian Kleineidam).

2.00  1998/07/05
* PUBLIC RELEASE 2.00
* No limits for number of directives and assignments per line.
* Better expansion of macros and variables assignments, now you can place
  variables into a directive (except from the IF test) or a macro arguments.
* You can use macros within a macro.
* A line ending with a single '\' will be joined with the next, so you can
  split long macro declarations, directives or variables assignments.
* The -d (--depend) switch now print the templates (as 1.34) and the config
  files dependencies.
* New switches: -q (--quiet), -g (--debug), -Wall, -Wnone, -W.
* Extension of raw and template files can be customized through
  DEFAULT_RAW_EXTENSION and DEFAULT_TMPL_EXTENSION.

1.34  1998/06/19
* PUBLIC RELEASE 1.34
* Fixed a bug when using built-in macros inside a macro definition, it was
  erroneusly expanded while the macro is declared and stored.
* Slightly changed some regexps into the Date and built-in macros blocks.

1.33  1998/06/14
* PUBLIC RELEASE 1.33
* If you don't give any valid filename wpp ends with an usage message.
* Constants defined through the -D switch now are really constants.
* Changed the error message when trying to change a costant value or using a
  reserved keyword for a variable name.

1.32  1998/06/11
* Added the command line -D switch for allowing the definition of contants.
  Useful when processing files from STDIN that needs to know and use values of
  constants like DEFAULT_OUTOUT_DIR (i.e. the HTML_IMAGE_SIZE use this value
  for retrieving the image file).
* Into the built-in macros section the print code is now disabled while wpp is
  running for generating dependencies.
* Some code clean-ups.

1.31  1998/06/05
* Fixed a bug that doesn't expand a macro if it's exactly at the end of a file.
* It traps overwriting constant values and any reserved keyword (previous
  versions catch only the first case).
* Some code clean-ups.
* Built-in macro HTML_IMAGE_SIZE that is expanded into the SRC field of an IMG
  tag with the WIDTH and HEIGHT if the image file is gif, jpeg or png.

1.30  1998/05/27
* PUBLIC RELEASE 1.30
* Fixed a bug that the leave the STDERR selected as STDOUT during the depend.
* Fixed some unused print code during the depend.
* The IF test now can be used to check if a macro is already defined.

1.29  1998/05/24
* PUBLIC RELEASE 1.29
* Variables substitution now works also in assignments, they can be splitted
  in two or more lines using \.

1.28  1998/05/23
* Using File::Basename for setting @FILENAME@. (wpp@proactiveresearch.com)
* Now saves the leading and the ending part of a line that contains an
  @INCLUDE@ directive or a variable assignment.
* Fixed a broken regexp that made possible with wpp 1.27 assign a value to a
  read-only variable.

1.27  1998/05/21
* PUBLIC RELEASE 1.27
* Removing some extra parentheses in ? tests.
* Macro declaration and call can be splitted on more than one line using \.

1.26  1998/05/20

* The extremes of a line in which a macro is called are now included.
* The last \n of the last line of a macro declaration is removed automatically.

1.24  1998/05/20
* Start working on macro expansion, added two new directives MACRO/ENDMACRO.
* The IF/ELSE/FI was officially changed into IF/ELSE/ENDIF.
