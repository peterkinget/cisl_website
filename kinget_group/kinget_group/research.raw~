<h2>Research Seminars </h2>

The Columbia Integrated Systems Lab has a regular research <a
href="http://www.cisl.columbia.edu/seminars/seminars.html">seminar series</a>
where external and internal speakers present their latest research
results. These seminars are open to the public. Email announcements
are sent out via <a
href="http://www.cisl.columbia.edu/seminars/seminars.html">a mailing list</a>.

<h2>Research Resources & Facilities </h2>

<h3>Chip Fabrication</h3>

<p> We have access to a number of different semiconductor processes for
the fabrication of our circuits through a fabrication service provides
(e.g., MOSIS, Europractice) as well as through direct relationships with companies and
foundries. We currently mainly use 90nm CMOS, 0.13um CMOS, 0.18um CMOS and 0.25um/40GHz BiCMOS
processes and are initiating our work in 65nm and 45nm CMOS
processes. Take a look at our <a href="gallery.html">Chip Gallery</a>!

<h3>Computing & CAD tools</h3>

<p> We use a full set of industrial grade design tools for our IC
designs. This includes tools suites from Cadence, Mentor and
Agilent. We use PC desktops running Linux as well as servers running
SunOS and Linux. 

<h3>Analog & RF IC characterization laboratory</h3>

<p> Our lab facilities went through a substantial upgrade during 2004
and 2005 thanks to an NSF MRI Grant (with Prof. Tsividis) in conjunction
with funding from Columbia University and the School of Engineering. We
currently have a state-of-the-art measurement facility for IC
characterization from DC to 40 GHz. We can measure on wafer circuits or
packaged devices. Our instruments allow a full characterization in the
frequency domain and time domain.
