<h2>Ph.D. Research Positions</h2>


<blockquote> <p><pl>We regularly have openings for research and teaching
assistantships for students interested in obtaining a Ph.D. degree with
research in analog, mixed signal, power conversion or RF integrated
electronics and systems. Prior experience in electronic design
(preferably including integrated circuit design) is a must.

<p><pl> A good knowledge of English including good presentation and
  technical writing skills are also crucial. 

<p><pl> Please check
out <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/admissions-0">the school's
graduate admissions page</a>
and <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/pages/academics/graduate/index.html">the
EE department's graduate program page</a> to learn about the various
requirements of our program.

<p><pl>The type of research projects we are
currently engaged in are listed on
our <a href="research.html">research</a> page. Note that some ongoing
research projects or new research directions we are pursuing are not all
listed on the website.

<p><pl> <i>Self-driven, highly motivated</i> candidates can
contact <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~kinget">Prof. Kinget</a>. Before
emailing, go carefully through this website. Please make sure your email
includes details on your education, on your motivation for graduate
  studies and on your prior research or design
experience. <b>At minimum, attach your resume and grades,</b> but also
consider including copies of relevant papers or research
projects. <b>Make sure to start the subject of your email with "[Prospective
Student]".</b> 

<p><pl><font color='red'>Due to the large volume of emails, not all emails
of qualified candidates can be answered.</font> However, if you are a
qualified candidate, please consider applying to our program. When
applying, make sure to check my name as one of the faculty you would
like to work with if you want me to review your application. The
integrated circuits and systems program at Columbia is growing and
several professors are likely to be hiring. But realize that competition
is very fierce and nothing is guaranteed until your application has been
reviewed and accepted by the admissions committee.
