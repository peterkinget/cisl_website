<h2>Analog & RF IC characterization laboratory</h2>

<p> We have established state-of-the-art laboratory facilities at Columbia
University specifically designed for the testing and characterization of
analog, RF and high-speed integrated circuits up to 40GHz. The
laboratory is generously equipped with major high-performance components
and test and measurement systems. State-of-the-art equipment has
recently been acquired through an NSF-MRI grant in 2003 and associated
matching funds from the University.
 
<p> The available instruments include a DC-40GHz spectrum analyzer, a
10MHz-40GHz 4-port network analyzer, a 4Gs/s real-time sampling and a
40-GHz bandwidth repetitive sampling oscilloscope, a 100kHz-6GHz vector
signal generator, a 100kHz-20GHz and a 100kHz-40GHz continuous-wave
microwave generators, high frequency passive and active probes,
precision multi-meters, and a precision audio signal analyzer. The lab
is equipped with an RF wafer probe station with a collection of DC-40GHz
RF probes.

<p> The lab further contains numerous lab accessories and general electronic
lab instruments such as power supplies, multi-meters, counters, function
generators, pattern generators, logic analyzers and oscilloscopes. Also
mounting equipment such a soldering stations and a bonding machine, and
a thermal chamber are available.

<p> An extensive set of professional CAD tools for integrated circuit
design, based on the Cadence Systems and Mentor Graphics tools
framework, is available. This includes schematic capture, circuit
simulators, logic synthesis and simulation tools, layout tools, and
verification and extraction tools. A network of high end workstations,
file servers and compute servers is available to run these tools.
