 The winners were announced on 21st September 2012 at the GigaOM's
 Mobilize conference held in San Francisco. The competition drew entries
 from top universities all across the United States and Canada, and
 consisted of a written proposal submission round followed by an
 incubation-phase round in which the teams were interviewed and
 submitted a final proposal.  The ultrasonic wireless technology can
 extend the battery life of wireless sensor nodes by more than an
 order-of-magnitude. The team has built a custom integrated circuit to
 demonstrate the ultra-low power operation of this technology. It has
 further field-tested proof-of-concept ultrasonic communication modules
